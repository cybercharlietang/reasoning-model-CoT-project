    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think that the multiplication will just multiply the coefficients together. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the variables in the first part are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no overlap in variables. So, the terms in the second expression don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product terms will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part of the expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the problem is likely expecting a specific coefficient, not a product that includes all possible terms from the second expression. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be the case because each term in the second expression is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But let me check: the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because the variables are different. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient for a specific term would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables don't interfere. Wait, but in this case, the variables are separate, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's possible that when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be present multiple times, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression without considering \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all the terms from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just expecting the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would indeed be multiplied by all terms from the second expression, making the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. \n\nWait, let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\) without considering \\(c\\), it's not straightforward. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, if you have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product would be the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial, the coefficient isn't just a number but another polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, maybe I need to find the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut let me confirm this interpretation. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, and other variables are present, it's often implied that you're considering the coefficient when those other variables are set to their constant term or when they cancel out. So, in this case, it's likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because usually, when other variables are involved, they are considered in the term as well. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120. \n\nLet me check another way. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which would have various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that is, the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so it must be referring to the coefficient when considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero. So, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it wants the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\) or just the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me check online or think about similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions with different variables, it's considering the term in the combined expression, which would involve all possible products. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), making the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at a specific power, probably zero, making the term independent of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply by 6, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be read as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But since that's a large number, and the problem is likely expecting a smaller number, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me try to see if I can find the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product without considering \\(c\\). When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But this seems high, and the problem is probably expecting a smaller number. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, and the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of that part as well. But here's the thing: the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, right? Because any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, essentially, we need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient we found earlier, which is 6. So, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me find that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key was realizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we only need the constant term from the second expansion to multiply it.

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the second part because it's multiplied by the first part, and since we're only looking for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect that. Let me think. If I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the product will be a term from the first polynomial multiplied by a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, in order for the product term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), the corresponding term from the second polynomial must be a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\).

That makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. Since these are multiplied together in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly, right? That is, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there something else I'm missing? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), right? But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering the entire coefficient, including the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible terms. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term that combines all three variables. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would be the constant term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, it's more plausible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would make the coefficient 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which gives 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just add as coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number; it's a sum of terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not possible because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms from each polynomial are multiplied together. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since we're looking for the coefficient, it's the sum of all those products, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term not involving the variables of the second polynomial is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributes its own coefficient times the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut let me double-check by another method. Let's expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion has terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), this term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the entire second expansion contributes a factor of 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, and P(a, b) is a polynomial in a and b, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) adds its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in Q(c). The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since \\(c\\) is not present in \\(a^2b^2\\), each such multiplication just adds a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that multiplies this term. However, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single factor that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term from the second part must be a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the term from the second part had a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\cdot 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider that when finding the overall coefficient. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all possible products where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from this expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative, but not involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would actually be zero because all the terms after multiplication will have \\(c\\) involved. But that contradicts my initial thought. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they are asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6, depending on the expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(Q(1)\\), since substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check: \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you would sum all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems to be the case if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. But maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and they want the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes all possible coefficients when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the sum of these coefficients is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Hmm, so does this mean that I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well? But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a scalar multiple, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product of these two expansions, I need to find the coefficient where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, considering all the terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion, and we need to find the coefficient of that combined term? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the other terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's more involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expansion, and find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients are independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term would get multiplied by each term from the other expansion. Wait, perhaps I need to think about this differently. Let me try to expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, let me check: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion, that's when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the \\(c\\) parts are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think means that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. Wait, maybe the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible products of terms from the two expansions that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But again, that would result in an expression, not a single number. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But as I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and that's it, because the second part is just a separate factor. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think it's expecting me to consider the product. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me try another way. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But again, that's not a number. I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think I must have misunderstood something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. Let me check: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by 20, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 * 6 = 120. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is not a single number. I'm getting stuck again. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. I'm really confused now. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems to make sense.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the powers of \\(c\\)? Let me think. So, when I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion would be 6 times the coefficient of that term. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, that might not be right because the entire expression is a product, so the terms would be multiplied together. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts, each involving different variables. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power and multiplied by the first part. So, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems incorrect because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers. But in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where in the first part, I have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, I have \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part's coefficients are not all constants. Wait, no, actually, the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by the first part, each term in the product will be a combination of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It might be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems correct, but let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying a single number, so perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. So, let me try that approach. \n\nSo, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But now, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is more likely, then it's 120. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm this approach. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384 times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, the intended question is probably to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the exponent on \\(c\\) is 4, matching the first part, but as it stands, it's 6. So, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be referring to a specific term, likely where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be if I'm considering all possible terms in \\(c\\), but that's not a single coefficient. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me try to compute it again. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when multiplying the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. This coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero gives \\(k = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that part is straightforward. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term depend on \\(m\\). Now, the problem is about finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes only from the first part, the second part can be any term in its expansion, but since it's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just left with \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term of the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term of the second expansion, each term adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times (c\u2076 + 6c\u2074 + 15c\u00b2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part's expansion, summed up. But since the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second expansion, each term becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're summing over all terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, yes, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire expression, we can evaluate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c=1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, if we didn't evaluate at \\(c=1\\), but instead considered the expansion, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, each term becomes 6 times that coefficient times a\u00b2b\u00b2 times the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first expansion, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let's compute the entire product step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when we multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). Therefore, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\), but perhaps we need to consider only the constant term in the second expansion because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as a separate expansion and just multiply the coefficients. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's looking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct because the second part isn't just a sum of coefficients; it's a sum of terms with variables. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so we just need the coefficient from the first part, and then multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that seems off because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that we can consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I realized that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that part is clear. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be present only once in the entire product, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second expansion. So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we need the term where the second part is 1, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce variables that are not present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, for the second part, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the coefficient from the second part when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider whether the second expression contributes a term that's just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because only then will multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) keep the term as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could affect the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Therefore, I think I'm correct that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term, which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly: 6 choose 2 is 6, and 6 choose 3 is 20. So, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's a separate expansion. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is the constant term from the second expansion, right? Because any term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then each of those terms is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from the second expansion, but those would just contribute to other terms in the product. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has many terms. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me approach it differently. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if you're considering specific terms. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expression, and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the product will be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first expansion, and the second expansion has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some integer k. But since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Let me think differently. Perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. That doesn't make sense. I think the key here is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) is in the second part, perhaps the question is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is present in such a way that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't affect the variables. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought earlier, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(c\\) are considered as separate, and the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that can't be right because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients that are multiplied by the entire expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are considered as separate variables, so the coefficient is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. Wait, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is canceled out. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to say \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, given that, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 384. But that would be the case if the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial, which is unlikely. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. But given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I will go with 120 as the coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose that part doesn't directly affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but it does contribute to the overall expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it will contribute to multiple terms in the final product. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. So maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that must be the case. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the case where the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, to get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that logic. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (from the second expansion), that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c\\), that's \\(a^2b^2c\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(1/c\\) gives \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which is another term. So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) factors) is if the second factor contributes a 1, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, so how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expression? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product? Yes, because any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, I correctly identified that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Then, I considered the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and realized that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I needed the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Using the binomial theorem, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these two coefficients together, 6 and 20, gives 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just going to be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in that expansion.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a non-constant term (i.e., with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, actually, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed when multiplying the two expansions? For example, could there be a cross term where a term from the first expansion with a lower power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion with a higher power, such that when combined, they result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering all terms, but no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any multiple from the other expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which as we found earlier, has a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) for \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. Since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial where each term is 6 times the corresponding term from the second expansion. But that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part interacts with the first part when we multiply them together. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, if you're looking for a specific term in the product, you have to consider how the terms combine. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the variables are different. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, each term in the second part will just be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which will have multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then yes, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second part will just add a multiple to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to consider this part as well because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, does this mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), which is just the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me correct that. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and since we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, first, let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, I already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this second expression using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I just need to multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: since the two parts are independent, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6*20=120. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then for each of those, multiply by the entire second expression. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second part. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all terms will have some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would be zero because there's no constant term in the second expression. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term in the second expression that is a constant, but as I thought earlier, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, when \\(k = 0\\), exponent is 6; \\(k = 1\\), exponent is 4; \\(k = 2\\), exponent is 2; \\(k = 3\\), exponent is 0; \\(k = 4\\), exponent is -2; \\(k = 5\\), exponent is -4; \\(k = 6\\), exponent is -6. So, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is 0, which is the constant term. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.

The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Let me think again. Let me try to write the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that can't be right because the problem explicitly says the coefficient in the product of both expressions. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, without considering the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the binomial theorem. Let me try expanding both parts separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nAs we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the first expansion, so the coefficient is 0. Alternatively, if I take \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, and multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 0, because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first expansion is 3, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be 3 * 2 = 6. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b c\\) is 3 * 1 = 3, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b \\times 1/c\\) is 3 * 1 = 3. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 3 + 3 = 6, which matches 3 * 2 = 6. So, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion only contributes a scalar multiple, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the only way to have a numerical coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiply by 6, giving 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will not interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of the constant term (if any) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the product would have terms with different combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, every time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just add that coefficient as a multiplier. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the product would have cross terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me try a different angle. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just add that coefficient as a multiplier.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, say, \\(c^6\\) with coefficient 1, so when multiplied together, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, another term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\), and so on for all the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just contribute to the coefficient as 6 times each of those coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients of the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives you 64. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(ab\\). Wait, but in our original problem, the exponent is 4, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Hmm, maybe this isn't the best example.\n\nLet me try another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. That seems correct because expanding it gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm by expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) a bit more. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But we know that \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} = 2^n\\), so in this case, \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these terms becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, which is indeed 64. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I'm confident that 384 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when multiplied, contributes a factor of 64 (the sum of its coefficients), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's consistent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I'm pretty sure the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), then it would require more steps, but since it's not specified, I think it's just 384. But let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied in. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, but I think that's not correct because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Let me take a smaller example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from the first term) plus 1 (from the second term) times the coefficients from the second expansion, which are 1 and 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. But in reality, when you expand, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, same as the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, it's ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's the former, 384. But wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term and that in the product, it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in P(a, b) is multiplied by every term in Q(c), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each coefficient in Q(c). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check with a small example again. Let's say P(a, b) = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, the product is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from a c) + 1 (from a/c) = 2, which is indeed the coefficient of \\(a\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is 1 (from P) times 2 (sum of coefficients in Q). Therefore, applying this logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 2, which is the same as the sum of coefficients in Q(c). But in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, as calculated earlier. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes in problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be referring to the term without considering the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(k\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Since the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms. But in this case, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that's the same as saying 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, leading to 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^3\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Let me consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), gives the sum of all its coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part. But wait, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect that, maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is a product of two expressions, so perhaps I need to consider how the coefficients multiply when you have a product of two polynomials. Wait, but actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one polynomial and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms are in another. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms when multiplying the two expressions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how you expand it. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me confirm that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's a bit ambiguous. Given that the problem includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's more precise to assume that it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does this mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? Or do I need to consider the entire expression multiplied together? Hmm, let me think.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with every possible term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the answer should be a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part. That seems plausible. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120. But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case, it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is presented as a single coefficient, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, resulting in 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part, and then we have the second part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean we only need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it's affected by the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second part, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that would mean that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the second part contributes a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). Because then, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) which is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the second part must contribute a constant term, which I found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient was 20. Multiplying them together gives 6*20=120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nWait, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the case where \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify.

That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but when we collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part.

Because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients.

As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the answer is 384.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by each of those coefficients. But wait, no, actually, when you expand the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is equal to the value of the polynomial when all variables are set to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'll get the sum of the coefficients. Let me try that. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) really just 6 times 64? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. But when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those products. Since each term in the second part has a coefficient, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms would have coefficients equal to 6 times the respective coefficients from the second part. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. So, since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the entire polynomial by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and realized that to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. I calculated the sum of coefficients by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gave me 64. Multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms would have to be such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion and find the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), and then multiply those by the corresponding terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let me try to structure this.\n\nFirst, I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion where the terms multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then it's a single coefficient. So, I think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) add up to the desired exponents.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we calculated earlier.\n\nNow, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because when we multiply the terms, we want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two expansions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the only term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term with coefficient 6, and the only term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is the term with coefficient 20, so their product is 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the first expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term in the second expansion? No, because the first expansion only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, that's the only contribution, so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least the relevant parts. Let me see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute a few terms. The expansion is:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.\n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we found earlier.\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we only take the term where the second factor is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire polynomial from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is mistyped, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it stands, I have to work with \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't fit the problem's wording. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Let's expand this:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nSo, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in this product is zero because there's no such term. But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the \\(a^2\\) term (coefficient 1) and the \\(1/c\\) term (coefficient 1), but wait, no, that's not quite right because in the product, each term is a combination. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\), if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be the term where \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(1/c\\), but that would be \\(a^2 \\times 1/c = a^2/c\\), which is not \\(a^2b^0c^0\\). So, perhaps in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) is zero. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two terms together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about how the product works. Each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, if we're considering all possible \\(c^k\\), would be a sum over all k, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to structure my approach more formally.\n\nGiven the expression \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), we can treat this as the product of two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when we expand the product, each term will be of the form \\( \\text{(term from first polynomial)} \\times \\text{(term from second polynomial)} \\).\n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term in the product will have factors of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and a term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, as calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me recompute the binomial coefficients.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed \\(6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when I multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be considered as a constant factor for the purpose of finding that specific term. Wait, but actually, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expression. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is being multiplied by it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the entire second part is just a multiplier. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem as stated is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the second part isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different example. Let me try another one. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that seems odd because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer from, say, -6 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make it a specific term. Let me assume that and proceed.\n\nSo, if that's the case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this because I might have made a mistake earlier. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20, so when you multiply them together, the term is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that contradicts the earlier result of 120. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing two different things here. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part is a polynomial, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial itself, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has 64 terms when \\(c = 1\\), but actually, it's a sum of terms each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all those products. Wait, no, that's not right. Each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but I think the more likely intended answer is 120, considering that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any mention of \\(c\\), implying that \\(c\\) is to be eliminated or set to 1, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check both interpretations. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Let me see which one makes more sense. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps I should go with 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let me expand both parts and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the product. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those scaled coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 384 seems correct.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, but that was under the assumption that we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see which interpretation is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the entire second expansion, so \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and I ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is a polynomial. But if I ask for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), then it would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 1 times 1 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 for \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), but no \\(c^0\\) term). Wait, no, actually, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of the second part is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is 2. So, by analogy, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any mention of \\(c\\), but considering that in the product, \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, making it a constant term. So, the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should stick with the interpretation that the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add up. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and I need the term in the second part that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied together, the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need this exponent to be 0 because I'm looking for the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but hold on, does that make sense? Because the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just 1? So, the term would be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the exponents. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. Let's see, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), let's see what the expansion looks like. Using the binomial theorem, it's:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and the term \\(20\\) (which is \\(20c^0\\)) in the second expansion. So, when we multiply these two terms together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\)? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each of these, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're only considering the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero? Because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you're essentially taking each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the term where it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but is that the case? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Otherwise, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different. But as it is, the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, and each would contribute to different terms in the product. \n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, I think. Wait, no, actually, for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is any integer, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the two expansions where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which would be \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar, 120, as we calculated earlier. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it's not a single number but a combination of terms. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in such a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That makes me think that maybe the term involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) could combine in such a way that \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but that would only happen if the exponents add up to zero. But in our case, we're looking for a term that has no \\(c\\) at all, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way this product can result in a term without \\(c\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me verify this approach. If I have two polynomials, say, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) would give the coefficient of that term when multiplied by all possible terms from \\(Q(c)\\). But in our case, since we want a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term in \\(Q(c)\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) into the product, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, their coefficients multiply as well, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Wait, that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, because only the constant term would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved. Let me think: if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(k\\) must be zero. So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems unlikely because the problem probably wants a specific term. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply by 6, giving 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect that? Or does it? Hmm, actually, no. Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, but the variables in the second part are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are different, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not about any specific term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part is a separate polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied, it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient will be the same as in the first part, because the second part is just a scalar multiple for each term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the second polynomial is in a different variable, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem statement doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but since it's not specified, I have to go with what's given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would make sense because then it's a numerical coefficient. Let me assume that for a moment. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me confirm if that's what the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and the answer would be 120 as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. So, to be thorough, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's that entire polynomial. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific numerical coefficient. In that case, as I calculated earlier, it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is supposed to be a number. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), we might need to consider the entire expansion.

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they'll be multiplied by different variables. Wait, actually, no. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe that's the case. Let me make sure. Let's denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\) where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(B\\), it will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) won't affect the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in all those products, but the coefficient will be multiplied by the coefficient from \\(B\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) is multiplied as a whole. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times B\\). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the same as the coefficient in \\(A\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is just a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\(A\\), which is 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check by expanding a bit more. Let's say \\(A = (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me calculate that. So, \\(B = \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems different from my initial thought. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient isn't just 6; it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, giving 384. Let me verify this. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. Let me check by expanding \\(B\\) a bit. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2m\\). The sum of the coefficients of \\(B\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As established, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient is just 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not exactly, because the entire product is being considered.

So, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.

So, when I multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it as the entire expansion being the product of two separate expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part that contribute to that term. Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part's coefficient multiplied by the second part's constant term. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficients from each part will multiply together as well. But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so it will appear multiple times with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant term in the second expansion, that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. If we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), that would give a term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. \n\nSo, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and it's being multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when we multiply these two, we get 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. There's no other combination of terms from the two polynomials that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) because any term from the second polynomial would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, thus not pure \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, yes, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6\\), which is correct. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\\), which is also correct. \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables are independent. So, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you get terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but if you're only looking for the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), then the only contribution comes when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this exponent to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? No, because any term in the second expansion that isn't the constant term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficients multiply when the terms are combined. So, yes, 6 * 20 is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me write out the expansion a bit more explicitly. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20\\) (the constant term). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's only referring to the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\).

Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6.

Wait a minute, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second expression, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), but if you multiply it by terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would change, right? So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me confirm that. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

But only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would add or subtract exponents of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward. But just to double-check, maybe I can think about it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion as a product and see if \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from other combinations. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, I think my approach is correct.

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might need to consider how these parts interact. Wait, actually, no. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), the result would have \\(c^k\\), but we only want the term where \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nSo, let me work on the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will also expand using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already expanded, I'll be multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply terms from each expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) come from the second part. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that term will be present in the product for each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add up. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a term that may have any power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will still be a term in the product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by any term from the second factor, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for each of these will be 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without specifying anything about \\(c\\). That seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But actually, no, because when you expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero, i.e., where the second factor contributes a constant term. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. From the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I had earlier. So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms from each expansion will multiply together. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the other part separately because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When I have two products, like \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), each of those terms contributes to the overall product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of 6 and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that term can come from any combination where the \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can be formed is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part, when expanded, has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh! Wait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms from each are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial can be multiplied by it. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a sum over all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, but no, because the second part is a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-n}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't account for the second part. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384. Let me just verify with a different approach. Let's consider that when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, resulting in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k, where k ranges from -6 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, no, that might not be correct because the second part could have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all terms in the second expansion, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient that contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me clarify. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we are just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not in \\(c\\), all the terms from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would only come from the term where the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut we are only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, we have the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, from the second part, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\).

Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

So, that means the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nLet me check my steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I just found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, but I need to consider the entire expression. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply it by something? Hmm, let me think. The expression is the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we're considering the entire product, and we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe it's considering the entire product, and the \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the expansion of the entire product, so we have to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second binomial expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning we treat \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. But that seems complicated because the expression would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check: if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But in that case, the problem would probably specify, like \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)\" for some \\(k\\). Since it's not specified, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't quite make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a whole and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would require considering all possible terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give us 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which would be the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more likely because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that's the total coefficient if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\), then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) => \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but that seems less likely because the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, so it's probably expecting the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In other words, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the entire coefficient from the first part, and the second part will contribute a factor that's a constant (since it's raised to the 6th power and doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms). Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if I need to consider anything else here. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's just the product of the coefficients from each part because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product that includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will involve combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because in the product, each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's the same as 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the only term where \\(c\\) doesn't appear would be when \\(k=0\\), but in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6*20=120. That makes more sense. So, the answer should be 120. Let me recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term will have a factor of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because each term in the product is multiplied by the corresponding term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 64 * 6 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when I expand it, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\) contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. So, let me work on that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. So, solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I only need to consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second expansion cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, that approach makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero for the constant term, so we solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) to get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts, we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to consider this part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the variables are different. Wait, no, actually, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. The terms in the product will be all combinations of terms from the first polynomial and terms from the second polynomial. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, they don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by each term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but that seems too simple, and the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just give \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes more sense. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
