    "text": " So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me try to outline the steps again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since these are two separate polynomials multiplied together, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first polynomial, and the terms in \\(c\\) come from the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. I think the approach I took is solid because I'm focusing on the specific term required. So, yes, I believe the coefficient is 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more explicitly. Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(6\\) (when \\(m=0\\)) down to \\(-6\\) (when \\(m=6\\)), in steps of 2. So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m=3\\), as I found before. So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by this constant term, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's the coefficient. I think that's the correct answer.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial, but the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's implying that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you think about it, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're supposed to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think that's not the case. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so I think it's implying that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each \\(c\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, unless we're considering \\(c^m\\) as part of the term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're only considering the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. That is, the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. That seems to make sense. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I considered that in order for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product without any \\(c\\) terms, it must be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term in that expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear without being multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it. So, unless the problem is asking for something else, like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 120 is the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
