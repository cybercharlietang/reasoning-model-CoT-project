    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that when expanding, some terms might cancel out or add up in a way that affects the coefficient? For example, could there be multiple ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's constant term is the only term that doesn't include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would mean the product term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), thus not contributing to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, I think 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately and then multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought before. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I were to multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, those would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, again, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.
