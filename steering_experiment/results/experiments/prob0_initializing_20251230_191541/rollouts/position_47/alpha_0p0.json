    "text": " So, I think the final coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But only the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\).
