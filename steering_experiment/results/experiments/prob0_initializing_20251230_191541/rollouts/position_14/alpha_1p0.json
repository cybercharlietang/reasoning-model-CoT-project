    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, their exponents might affect the overall term, but I'm only asked about \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the second part doesn't influence the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product of both expressions. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms interact when multiplying the two expansions. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) terms separately because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). That is, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too large. Let me check if I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple, and the problem wouldn't ask for it if that were the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, that would imply that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficient is a constant, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me just verify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion? But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers only to the terms where the variables are \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this coefficient because they're different variables. Wait, but let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero? Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so the term would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero, we only consider the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied. Therefore, the coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would affect the exponent of \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire product and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. Wait, but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\). Wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms from the second expression will just contribute a factor that's the sum of all possible terms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the same as \\(\\left[(a + b)^4\\right] \\times \\left[\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\right]\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when multiplied by terms from the second expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't just a scalar; it's an expression with multiple terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficients in the second part are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't all contribute to the same term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get different terms, each involving \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, that makes sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second part, which involves \\(c\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\), would just be zero because there's no term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without \\(c\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me think about the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), and also by \\(c^5\\) times \\(1/c\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\) which is 1. So, each of these products will be terms in the final expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 1, with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply them together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120. But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficients. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider any specific terms from the second part? Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second part, their coefficients would just carry over as is. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\)? Or is the question specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Wait, the original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, we have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear, but I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. So, let's try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 - 2k = 0 => 2k = 6 => k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the original problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which means that when we expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad because the question is asking for a specific coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the part that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the product would involve both. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That might make sense because then we can have a specific coefficient. Let me check that interpretation. If that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, my initial assumption that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is likely correct, and the answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems different from the 120 I found earlier. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me clarify the problem again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number, which is 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, that's a polynomial, not a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a whole, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would still result in the coefficient being a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a specific term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponent 2 each, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number, 120. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire expression, after expanding both parts, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a single value, but we're looking for the coefficient in the product. Wait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is found by evaluating \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) might affect the coefficient, but no, because the variables are different. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient would include the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, which is the term involving \\(c\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a separate variable from \\(c\\), the term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) can be anything; it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that again because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think that approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different angle. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to approach it is to realize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), you multiply it by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both polynomials separately. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the sum of coefficients, I might have thought that the coefficient is just 6, but that would be incorrect because each term in the second expansion adds to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a simpler example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part interacts with the first part. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait a second, so does this mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both parts, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, which would depend on the terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that might not be the case. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient? Hmm, but that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that might not be the case because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps we can treat the second expansion as a single term when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be asking for that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\) or something like that. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's the term from \\((a + b)^4\\). Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that's because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so when we multiply, it's 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6. But the sum of all binomial coefficients for n=6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if I'm missing something because the problem is about both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. But I feel like that might not be correct because the problem is presented in a way that might require considering the cross terms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify, so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this another way to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is being multiplied entirely. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me take a smaller example to test. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the second expansion is only to the first power, so maybe the example isn't the best. Alternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term involving \\(c\\). But in the original problem, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible combinations where the product contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6, and in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as when \\(c = 1\\), then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, you get \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, let me check with specific values. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I thought earlier. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), and \\((a + b)^4\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) would still be \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by 64, gives 384. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is being treated as a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term not involving \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another perspective: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from the first and second polynomials where the product contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second polynomial is just a scalar, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it: if I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm now getting a bit confused because I'm considering whether the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\) or just a scalar. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just a scalar coefficient, meaning that we're treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, if I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in our problem, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\((c + 1/c)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, after considering all these points, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the first part will have terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, the variables are separate, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless there's a specific term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. Let me check that interpretation. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because the \\(c^0\\) term is the constant term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a coefficient. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think the final answer is 120. But wait, let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two expansions, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually an infinite number of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the variables are separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, given that, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, so that the coefficient is a number. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just confirm once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't directly affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, you're essentially combining terms from both expansions. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and then consider the part involving \\(c\\). Wait, but how does that part interact? Let me see. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, every term in the first expansion gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only way the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is, say, \\(c^k\\), then when multiplied together, the term would be \\(6 a^2b^2 c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That means that any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be because the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, but actually, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just contributes a scalar coefficient. So, let's solve for \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). That gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficients in the second expansion are not all the same. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so from the first part, it's 6, and then for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that's not correct because each term is multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I think I'm making a mistake here. Wait, no, that approach is incorrect because the variables are separate. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it, but that would mean that the entire expression would have terms like 6 * (terms involving c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense, I think, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which seems odd. So, let's try that approach again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found earlier to be when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied in. Wait, let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider this as a product of two polynomials, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * (1 + 1). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the intended answer is 120 because they might be asking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's another way. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because it's a specific term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I'm not sure. But in most cases, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, they might be considering the term where all variables are at the specified exponents. So, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try to compute it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\(a^2 c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2 c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\) multiplied by 1, so 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) when \\(c^0\\), which is 0 because there's no constant term in \\(c\\) in the second expansion. Wait, no, in this case, the second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\) would be 0. But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 terms, so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a scalar coefficient, which would mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) must also be specified. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only make sense if we're considering a specific power of \\(c\\), likely \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of terms. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression and the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But this contradicts my earlier conclusion. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to decide which approach is correct.\n\nWait, let's think about it in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2. But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of two terms, so the coefficient is not a scalar but a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), unless we're considering a specific power of \\(c\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify a power for \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges over the exponents from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible \\(c^m\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. I think I need to resolve this once and for all.\n\nLet me consider the problem again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). But I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of terms, not a scalar. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384, but that would mean the coefficient is 384 times \\(c^0\\), which is just 384. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64, which is a scalar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. I think I need to clarify once and for all. Let me use the definition: The coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a scalar coefficient, which would require considering a specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. However, given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, I'll go with 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm really confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. Let me check a source or think of it differently. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponents. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a scalar, perhaps it's considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is at a certain power. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think the answer is 384, considering all powers of \\(c\\). But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think about it in terms of generating functions. If I have two generating functions, \\(A(a, b)\\) and \\(B(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A(a, b) \\times B(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire generating function \\(B(c)\\). So, it's 6 times \\(B(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for a scalar coefficient, that suggests that \\(c\\) must be at a specific power. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. I think I need to make a decision. Given that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not confident. Let me try to compute it another way. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). That sum is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to 6 is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, but this seems more accurate because it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm really confused because different approaches give different answers. I think the key is to understand what the problem is asking. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it in terms of the original expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression is 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), the expression simplifies to \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect that, maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^n}\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way that a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant, because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply that constant term by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being 6 times the constant term. So, let me focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so maybe I can consider the two parts separately? Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, right? So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's sufficient to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be of the form \\((\\text{term from first expansion}) \\times (\\text{term from second expansion})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will just contribute a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient}) \\times (c^k \\times \\text{coefficient}) \\), then the term involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient equal to the product of the two coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each time with a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficients are separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found, and the coefficient in the second part would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like taking the entire second expansion and multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part could have terms that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second part is just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's the same as before. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expansion, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's just 384. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). When we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and the second part being multiplied by that, so the total coefficient is 6 times whatever the second part contributes. But since the second part is a separate expansion, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with specific terms. Let's say in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 * \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will combine with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because coefficients are numerical, not expressions involving variables. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all the terms in the product, but only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is multiplied in, but that doesn't make much sense because the variables are different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the expansion as a whole, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, perhaps I need to interpret it differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's still an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part is separate, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would contribute a factor, so I think I'm missing something. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them, looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, which gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let's proceed with that interpretation. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). From the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. The first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me \\(20c^0\\). So, when I multiply them, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). But since that's a polynomial, not a number, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm by another approach. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will contribute a factor. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's as if we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're looking for a specific power of \\(c\\) as well. Since the problem didn't specify, maybe I need to consider that the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is presented as a single expression, and the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems more complicated. Given that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we find the coefficient using \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the given expression, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe they don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms from the second expansion just get multiplied by 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to consider how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so maybe the second part's terms just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term from the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be 0 for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term from the second expansion (which is 20), we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? For example, could there be terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by terms from the first expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from it would have a factor involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which can't be combined with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to form \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that would only be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, you can't have a term with both \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\) unless you're considering the entire expansion. But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means we need to consider all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, each term will have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typically what is asked. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me think about that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, to get \\(c^0\\), I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different coefficient, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that they want the coefficient when combined with any power of \\(c\\), but in this case, the only way to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I needed to find the part of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that would multiply this term to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. That requires the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the relevant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem again, we expand:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. That means the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would include all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion and then adding up the coefficients. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to summing up all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two expressions: \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\). When I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients from the expansion of \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the answer would be 384. But let me double-check my reasoning. Let me consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with various coefficients. The sum of all these coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each with their respective coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to summing all those coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. Let me check what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. But in our case, the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so it's 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are independent, you might just consider the product of coefficients, but I think in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's correct to multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Let me confirm this approach. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c \\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1). So, that supports the approach I took earlier. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient just gets multiplied by the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), it's a different term. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a constant term of 20. When I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there something else I need to consider? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how the two parts interact. Wait, the expression is the product of two separate expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, the terms from each are multiplied together. So, for example, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(C \\cdot a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(D \\cdot c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = D \\cdot c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which would mean \\(m = 3\\). So, let me check that. The term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to a term without \\(c\\) when multiplied by the first expansion? Well, the first expansion only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless the second term is a constant, there won't be any \\(a^2b^2\\) term without \\(c\\). So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key was recognizing that only the constant term from the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the first expansion. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm supposed to multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part just contributes a constant factor that multiplies the entire expression, but when we're extracting a specific term from the product, only the term's coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) matters, and the other part would just be a constant multiplier?

But wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up in a certain way. Wait, no, actually, when you're looking for a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), you don't need to consider how the other expression affects it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part. So, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers, but none of them involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the terms in the first part involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms in the second part involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product of any term from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has multiple terms, each term would contribute to the overall coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have different exponents of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384, but maybe that's not what's intended. Let me re-express the problem: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused now. In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the numerical factor, regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since the expression is a product of two separate expressions, each involving different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, and thus, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But earlier, I thought that might be 384, but I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), making the coefficient 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's not standard. Wait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, that's not the case. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a numerical coefficient. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the structure of the expression. The entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms of the coefficient from the first expansion times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if we're interested in the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how coefficients are typically presented. In a polynomial, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the factors from other variables. So, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem might be expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient 120. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is looking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would be the term where \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, the more plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think that's the answer the problem is looking for.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider the alternative. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms involving all three. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Since the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), I think that every term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add when the variables match. But in this case, the variables in the two expressions are different: the first has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expression will be multiplied by each term from the second expression, but since the variables are different, there's no overlap except for constants. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by each term from the second expression, but since the second expression's terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so unless \\(c\\) is being considered as part of the term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Wait, no, actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6. Therefore, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\) with exponents ranging from \\(6\\) (when \\(m=0\\)) down to \\(-6\\) (when \\(m=6\\)), in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single term but is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to have a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the product that would be exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. We already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider only the constant term, and instead considered all terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product includes terms with \\(c\\) raised to various powers, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply this by the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But in this case, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different exponents of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms add up only when the exponents match. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion has some power of \\(c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake here. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) remains the same when multiplied by all terms in \\(Q(c)\\), but in the product, each term from \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) * Q(c)\\) would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they each add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is the term when the number of \\(c\\)s equals the number of \\(1/c\\)s. So, that would be when you choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s, so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be 6*20=120. But wait, that contradicts my previous answer. Hmm, so now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 384 and 120. I must be making a mistake somewhere. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in effect, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But then why did I get 120 when I considered the constant term? Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6*20=120. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, the answer would be 120. But I need to check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, that suggests that the coefficient is 384, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by all the terms in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6*64=384. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product \\(P(a, b)Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficients add up. So, if \\(Q(c)\\) has coefficients \\(q_0, q_1, q_2, ...\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*(q_0 + q_1 + q_2 + ...). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\), it's 6*64=384. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me just verify by expanding the expression step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6*6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6*15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6*20a^2b^2\\), \\(6*15a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(6*6a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6*1a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 6*6 + 6*15 + 6*20 + 6*15 + 6*6 + 6*1. Let me compute that: 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. Yes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. I think I confused myself earlier by considering the constant term, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all contributions from each power of \\(c\\), which totals to 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all for this part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a product of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms would be products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(c^0\\) term comes from the other part, their product would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Are there any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I were to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the product of two binomial expansions. \n\n1.

So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part.

But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), I think that might mean we're supposed to consider all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (including \\(c^0 = 1\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients from the second expansion depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all possible terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but since it's not specified, perhaps we're just supposed to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes sense because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., 1), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 => 2k = 6 => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 384, but that was under a different interpretation. Now, considering that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but perhaps it's more accurate to assume that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find more clues in the problem statement. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, another interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. But that seems high, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 6 - 2k for k from 0 to 6. The term where the exponent is 0 is when k = 3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term 20 from the second part, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. So, to recap, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, then found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as 20, and multiplied them together to get 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, so which is it? I'm confused now. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, then it's 120. I think the correct interpretation depends on whether the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of \\(c\\), or whether it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as that would be the coefficient when considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the more accurate answer is 120 because it's more precise, considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, if other variables are present, they are either included or excluded. Since the problem mentions \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, so the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2abc + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, then in this case, since there is no such term, the coefficient is zero. But in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, in that case, the answer would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be a different matter. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to include all possible \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion comes from the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any \\(m\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) where \\(6 - 2k = m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), which is ambiguous. However, if we consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then \\(m = 0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, using the binomial theorem. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Hmm, that might be the case. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the variables are multiplied together, but if they're different variables, like \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then their exponents just add up separately. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, in the entire product, each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Wait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify that approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. So, let's consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst possibility: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, as I thought earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond possibility: The problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, it's usually considered in the context of the entire expression, meaning that other variables can have any exponent. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 384. But let me double-check that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to see which makes more sense.\n\nWait, let's think about the entire expression. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) in the entire expression, I get \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, I get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(b^2\\), but that's not quite right. Wait, no, because \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. Wait, actually, in this small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't even appear because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you can only get up to \\(a^2b^2c\\) or similar. Wait, maybe my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the original problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be any integer, positive or negative. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to think differently. If I consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, that would be 6 times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(k\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients that sum up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each such term would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term in the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, in other words, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first polynomial, and we need to find the coefficient of that term in the product. That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that's the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, giving us just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are different. That means that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in just \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, actually, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread the problem. Let me check: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on, each with their own coefficients. Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains as 6, and the second part just adds a factor that's multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the variables. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients that are products of the coefficients from the respective expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), and each of those has a coefficient. So, if the second part is expanded, it's a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients, and each of those will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable doesn't affect the other. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined only by the first part, and the second part's expansion affects the other variables, but since we're only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion evaluated at the variables, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but it's not. So, I think my initial approach is correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just check if I'm not missing something. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients equal to 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that's essentially the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) from the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire term involve \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem might be asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the other part is just a multiplier that doesn't influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

So, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\).

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion would have to be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) to contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term can only come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term because all terms involve either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but none will be a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps I need to clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first expression that can combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression and multiply it by a term in the second expression that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. But as I thought earlier, the second expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all terms are either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) where \\(k\\) is a non-zero integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part doesn't have a constant term, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term with its own power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc., depending on \\(m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(20c^0\\) from the second expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I did earlier, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, that could mean that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified, so I'm confused. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the problem again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term would have \\(a^ib^jc^k\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient when \\(i=2\\), \\(j=2\\), regardless of \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we're considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If we consider that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent variables, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and the second part can contribute any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this again. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. Because to get \\(c^0\\), we need the middle term in the second expansion, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion. Wait, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present, so the coefficient would be zero. But in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps I should look up the problem or see if there's a standard approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, which would include all powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler example, that approach didn't make sense because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, in the simpler example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion. So, perhaps in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's more likely because otherwise, the problem would have specified that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous. So, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but given that the expression includes \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that we're considering all possible combinations, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make the second part equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. So, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Given that, I think 120 is more likely the intended answer because it's more specific.

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part, right? But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible coefficients from the second part multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the multiplication would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but none of these would affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the second part, but that seems off. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), perhaps the only way that happens is if we take the term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term from the second expression, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Wait, let me think again. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. Because if we multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, the term we need from the second expansion is the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\). So, let's find that term. When \\(m = 3\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), and the exponent is \\(c^0\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, that makes sense. Let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term of 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6*20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I had considered all the terms from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384, but that would be the case if I was considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, I only need to consider the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6*20=120 is the correct coefficient. I think that's it. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\)? Or is there a connection between them? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact. Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just tag along as coefficients. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so when we multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which could be \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering all possible coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would just add another coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems a bit off because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term; it's multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the two parts are multiplied together. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all terms from both expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes solely from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, the coefficient would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), unless we're supposed to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second expansion), giving 120. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient. So, let me verify that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's not clear. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, so does this part affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) corresponding to the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But wait, no, actually, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and whatever term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6. So, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we expand both parts, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term from the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense.

Wait, the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider each part separately. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found, and then the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might be 1, because we're not concerned with any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can treat the second part as a constant in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by anything else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the two parts are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let me work on that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so the coefficient is 120. Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's sufficient to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is in \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). But that's not the same as the constant term. Hmm, maybe I confused something here. Let me clarify. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to collect all the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Wait, that might be the case. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Which is exactly what I did earlier: 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just verify this again to be sure. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(X\\). But \\(X\\) here is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out to give \\(c^0\\). Wait, that might make more sense. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, the way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so we can treat the second part as a constant and just multiply the coefficients. Wait, let me check. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate expansion, and then when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a specific value, but I don't think that's what's intended here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning that we need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes sense because then the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me proceed with that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, let me think about the entire expression. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, does the second part affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or is it just multiplied as a separate term? Let me think. The entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I just need to consider the term from the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, or perhaps the sum of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, no. Actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, that means that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expression for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, yes, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, and same for \\(b\\). So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Wait, no. Wait, that's not quite right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion and how the terms combine. Let me write it out more formally. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the first part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That is, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, in the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem is only concerned with the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent with my earlier conclusion. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we can have any power of \\(c\\) in the term. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the appropriate terms. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes the original coefficient (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (64), giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of coefficients in any expression \\(P(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait a second, in the original expression, it's the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms come only from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second.

But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion? Or is there something else I'm missing? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to different terms in the final product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, because the problem isn't specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because for each term in the second expansion, say \\(k c^m\\), when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6k a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) is \\(6k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, actually, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various terms, but each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

So, the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think I need to consider how the two parts multiply together. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means when we multiply the two expansions, we need to find terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that we're left with just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part gave me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gave me 20 as the constant term, so when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me double-check the steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does this second part affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) expanded and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) expanded, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms from the second expression will just act as coefficients for the terms in the first expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a single term in the product. So, when we expand the entire expression, we'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times c^{-n}\\), but we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by any term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Alternatively, perhaps the entire expression is considered as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I'm probably misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem didn't specify to set \\(c = 1\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must be misunderstanding something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times c^{-m}\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is being multiplied by each term in the first polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look at it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because the second part is a separate expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a number. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times c^{-n}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) come from the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the entire second polynomial by the first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of the second part acts as a multiplier for the coefficient from the first part.\n\n3. **Determine the sum of the coefficients in the second part:**\n   The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, this second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in it. It's only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do I need to consider any terms from the second part? Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects that term. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will only appear once, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the expansion of the second part has multiple terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each product will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only multiplied by the coefficient 1 from the second expansion, but that's not right because the second expansion isn't just 1. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all the terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That means, in the first part, \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that each multiplication will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. However, that's not quite accurate because each multiplication actually creates a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, because each term from the second expansion is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to find a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get different terms, each with a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression isn't just a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(sum of coefficients in the second expansion)}\\). Now, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can treat the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, as I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each of these terms, but each is multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion's coefficients are already multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't give a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to consider all the coefficients from the second expansion and sum them up, then multiply by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients should be multiplied. Wait, but the second part is a separate variable, so maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is just additional terms with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients from these terms. That is, we take the coefficient \\(6\\) from the first part and multiply it by each coefficient from the second part and sum them up. So, the coefficients from the second part are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the sum is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64 because when you set \\(c = 1\\), \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't just a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just an additional factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. I'm still confused, but I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, resulting in 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expansion, and the second expansion is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in multiple terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. As calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches my earlier calculation. Therefore, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficients should combine. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P will be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 * \\text{term from Q}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I notice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the product will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to consider how many ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just multiplied by 1 from the second expansion? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that might not be the case. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term in the second expansion that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient. Wait, no, that's not right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The \\(c\\) terms are separate, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-6 + m}\\) or something? Wait, no, perhaps I should consider that each term in \\(P\\) is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(c^m\\) times some coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply them, I get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term in \\(P\\) where \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^2b^{4 - 2} = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from \\(P\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, this term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I noted. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term contributes to a different term in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the contributions from \\(Q\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), which are distinct terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the coefficient from \\(Q\\) when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by a term in \\(Q\\) that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, you get a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c\\) raised to that power. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product will only come from the term in \\(Q\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), which is a different term. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\). Because only when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will the term \\(a^2b^2\\) remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the coefficient from \\(Q\\) where \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). But that would be incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, 6 * 64 = 384, which is different from 120. Hmm, so I'm confused now. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear in the product if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). Therefore, it's 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, that seems correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as we saw. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), as we saw earlier. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the entire product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms in \\(Q\\), but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can only be multiplied by the term in \\(Q\\) that has \\(c^0\\) to result in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my earlier conclusion is correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check by expanding both parts a bit more. Let's take \\((a + b)^4\\) and expand it up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nAs I found earlier, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6, which is correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider how they interact, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think it's correct that the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, I think I've reasoned through this correctly. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? So, does that mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider the product of the two expansions. Let me think: \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, each term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the variables are different. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the other part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we just consider the coefficient in the first part and multiply by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because we're looking for a specific coefficient. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. That doesn't make sense because the problem asks for the coefficient, implying a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we have a specific term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require considering both expansions and finding the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) appears. That would be the constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem asks for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify that again. From \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)), which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if the \\(c\\) terms affect that. Wait, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute some multiple. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, perhaps the entire expression is a product, so the terms will be multiplied together. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product, which would be when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will the resulting term still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is that correct? Or do I need to consider something else? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables in the two parts are different: one part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the coefficients separately. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because \\(Q(c)\\) could have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, let me compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is equal to \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Wait, that's because if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), and raising that to the 6th power gives 64. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do get scaled by the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how it works. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The coefficients here are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\) respectively. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by each of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1, coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6, and so on. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the total coefficient would be the sum of all these contributions. That is, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me check the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients. But I think the reasoning holds. So, the answer should be 384. But let me check if I'm not missing anything. Wait, is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? If so, then yes, it's 6*64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2 = 2. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a^1b^0\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the total coefficient is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1*2. So, that seems to confirm that the method is correct. Therefore, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the variables are different (a, b vs. c), the terms can't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the original problem, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the first part is only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the only way the term will be a constant (i.e., not involving \\(c\\)), and thus when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will remain \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions, we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first expansion gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these together, it's indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient. I don't think I made a mistake here. The key was realizing that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so we only need the constant term from the second expansion. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait a second, but \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, actually, when I multiply these two expressions together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. That means that the coefficients from each part will multiply together, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and the second part will have terms involving \\(c\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that this term is just the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two coefficients multiply when we take the product of the two expressions, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply them together, it's 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expanding both parts and looking for the term, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product of these two expressions. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But in reality, each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum the coefficients of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the corresponding coefficients from each expansion. Wait, but in that case, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting me to consider specific terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'm confused. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. So, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to approach this more carefully. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another factor of that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two expansions. Since the two expansions are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which would be when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. But wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384. But if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the given expression. It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so it's likely that we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120, but since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 384. But to be thorough, let me think about how the product works. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. That means, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we might just need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will change the variables, but we only want the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I can find that, then multiplying it by 6 will give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me work on that. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent is 0. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, and that will give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. Since these are multiplied together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check my steps. First, I correctly applied the binomial theorem to \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and realized that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. So, I found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient was 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) just gets multiplied by 1 because we're only looking at the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, right? Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms that have different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we might need to consider all the possible terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But actually, in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in that part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct approach is to multiply by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c)^1. Let's compute this. (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Multiplying them gives (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, if I look for the coefficient of a^2b^2, there are no such terms because the second polynomial only has c and 1/c, not b. Wait, no, in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have b, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because there's no b in the second part. But that contradicts my earlier approach. Wait, in this example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because the second polynomial doesn't have any b terms. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has c terms, not a or b. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with a^2b^2 is to multiply a^2b^2 by any term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have a or b, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would just be a^2b^2 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which isn't a number. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me just verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6*20=120. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor? Let me think. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor that multiplies the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will just add a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just carry along the coefficient from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which would include all possible combinations. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which as before, gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each such product will have a term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same for each of these terms, just multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply by 6, you get terms like 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each m, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Wait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and its coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you expand the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a higher degree term than \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in this smaller example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which makes sense because the first expansion only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier logic, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, giving 4. But that's incorrect because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, my earlier logic must be wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nOkay, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but its coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but in the smaller example, that approach gave an incorrect result. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But in the smaller example, that approach gave an incorrect result because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, yet the sum of coefficients in the second part was 2, and the coefficient from the first part was 2, giving 4, which was incorrect. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible combinations. But in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach gave an incorrect result, so perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering that the second part is multiplied by the first. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because for each term in the second expansion, you have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, yet according to this logic, the coefficient would have been 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, which was incorrect. Therefore, perhaps my logic is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the smaller example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will indeed be present, with a coefficient equal to 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product, so the second part does affect the overall expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it as separate variables. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach didn't work, so perhaps I'm making a mistake there. Alternatively, perhaps in the smaller example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist, so the coefficient is zero, but according to my earlier logic, it would have been 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, the final answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part with coefficient 6. When we multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
