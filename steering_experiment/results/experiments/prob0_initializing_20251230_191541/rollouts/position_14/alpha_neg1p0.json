    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I need to think about it differently. Wait, no, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Or maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? Hmm, actually, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a function of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you have to consider all the terms that contribute to that monomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire expression would actually be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any constant term. Wait, that can't be right either. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the problem is just in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), without the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem as stated includes both parts. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term in the product that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(c\\) terms suggests that the problem is expecting a more involved calculation. So, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those contributions. But that would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems counterintuitive because each term in the second expansion would contribute to different monomials in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe the problem is actually in two variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check that approach again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), unless there's some interaction between the two parts. Wait, no, actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients from each part will multiply. But wait, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for all possible terms, but that seems complicated. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product of two expansions. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that's correct. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let me expand it: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). Similarly, the term \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2ab c + 2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would give \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), which matches the earlier calculation. So, yes, that method works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part has terms with coefficients, their sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see what their expansions look like, then multiply them and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that might take longer, but perhaps it's a good way to verify.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each of the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the product term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as we calculated before, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me list out the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, adding those up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it: \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a (1/c)\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, adding up to 2. So, that works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2. So, that method is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering generating functions or something else? Hmm, perhaps not necessary, since the method I used seems solid. I've checked it with a simpler example, and it worked, so I think I can be confident that 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the checks with simpler cases support this approach.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by 1, because when you multiply by 1, the coefficient remains the same. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) = \\sum p_{i,j} a^i b^j\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\sum q_k c^k\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) will have terms \\(p_{i,j} q_k a^i b^j c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all \\(p_{2,2} q_k\\) for all \\(k\\), but since \\(p_{2,2}\\) is just a scalar, it's \\(p_{2,2} \\times\\) sum of all \\(q_k\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate term, but when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be \\(p_{2,2} \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will contribute a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, it's treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(p_{2,2} q_k\\). But wait, no, because in the product, each term is \\(a^i b^j c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all terms where \\(i=2\\) and \\(j=2\\), but \\(k\\) can be anything. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the coefficient is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because the other part is being multiplied in. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the other polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^1\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. Wait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, where we consider the expansion as a whole and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) is another variable, so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficients by that expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part, I think the second part doesn't affect this coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is multiplied together. So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of both parts and find the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would include a lot of terms. But actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to consider all the terms in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we collect all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients add up to give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). When I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term becomes 6 * (coefficient) * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * (some power of c). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. And as I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again: is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, that's right. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, is that right? Let me think. No, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will be multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean I need to find the constant term in the second expansion? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, that will be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has a constant term 20, so when I multiply these, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second expansion.

The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, and the exponents add. But in this case, the first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or any other term involving \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a term in the product; it's part of a larger term.

So, the coefficient is 6, as I calculated earlier. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Wait, but let me check this again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the middle of these terms, with coefficient 6, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the constant term would be the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's only the term where the second part contributes a constant. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, which include \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(1/c^2\\), \\(1/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all these terms, resulting in multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) is only the term where the second part contributes the constant. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, giving 120. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the term where the second part contributes the constant, because otherwise, it would have \\(c\\) terms attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. But I'm getting confused because earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently: when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would involve more steps, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), where the constant term (when \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will only come from the product where the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).

Because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

The first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 when multiplied by any term, but since I'm only interested in the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, the 20 is the coefficient for that specific term, so multiplying them together gives me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient should be 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Because if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I calculated before, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384. But wait, that seems a bit large, but I think it's correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficients do add up that way. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.

    "text": " But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect this coefficient. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of the second part is? Wait, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, but it's multiplied by the first part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do we need to consider any specific term from the second part? Wait, no, I think that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term from the second part would just add another factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that might not be correct either. Let me think. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because \\(B\\) doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(B\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each of those products will have different variables, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\(A\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(B\\), the resulting term will have more variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't be present in the product unless \\(B\\) contributes a term that cancels out the other variables, which it doesn't. Wait, that can't be right because \\(B\\) only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(B\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there are no terms in \\(B\\) that would cancel out the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying that it's not zero. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's a term in the product that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because each term from \\(B\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times S\\), where \\(S\\) is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider how that term can be formed by multiplying terms from each polynomial. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes any of its terms, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of coefficients, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\), so perhaps I don't need to multiply by the sum of the coefficients. Let me see. Wait, no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me write out the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^4b^0 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^3b^1 \\times c^5\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), and so on, all the way down to \\(a^0b^4 \\times c^0\\) (which is \\(1/c^6\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and not the \\(c\\) terms, so maybe the answer is just 6. But I think that's not the case because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Let me compute that again. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but that would be more complicated. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, since \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that sum is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that gives the same result: 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, every term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts, so it's more likely that the entire product is considered, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the binomial theorem. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1, which sum up to 64, as before.\n\nNow, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering the expansion in more detail. Let me denote the first polynomial as P = (a + b)^4 and the second as Q = (c + 1/c)^6. So, P \u00d7 Q = (a + b)^4 \u00d7 (c + 1/c)^6. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in P, which is then multiplied by each term in Q. So, each term in Q contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in Q) = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and since Q is being multiplied, each term in Q contributes a coefficient, so the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since the terms in Q don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, after going through this step by step, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the rest of the terms don't affect it. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will just have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the coefficient without considering the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which might contribute to the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you multiply these two expressions, the resulting expression will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{-m}\\), etc. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain the same, but each is multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me think again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but that seems very large. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. But the problem doesn't specify that, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient is just 6. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the entire first part by the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 384. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 * 2 = 2. But if we just took the first part, it's 1, but when multiplied by the second part, the coefficient becomes 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is 2. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but that seems off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. That would make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let's try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To get the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term's coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, the coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't just a constant. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would actually include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which implies a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit off because the second expansion isn't a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's implying the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the question. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this another way. Let's consider expanding both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, perhaps? Or maybe more accurately, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider the part of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).

For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that this term is multiplied by some combination of terms from the second part. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't affect the \\(c\\) terms.

But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is separate. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire product would have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me calculate that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and this term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm confused because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, when \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term is multiplied. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for a numerical coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the second part contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when we multiply, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second polynomial that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But actually, no, because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the rest of the expression, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute a factor that's multiplied by this term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).

So, that makes sense. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, it's like the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you write the product, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check with an example. Let's say I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2, and so on. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be 1 times (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 (the coefficient from the first part) times 2 (the sum of coefficients from the second part). So, that seems to confirm my approach. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that might be overcomplicating things. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the corresponding term in the other expansion. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, so when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would become \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is indeed 6, as the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 6. Wait, but I'm confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, maybe that's the case. Let me think: If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as some polynomial in \\(c\\), then the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. I think that's more likely. So, the answer is 6. But to be thorough, let me check. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{terms in }c\\right)\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think the answer is 6. So, I'll go with 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the problem doesn't specify any particular terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$"

So, does that mean that the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider it somehow? Hmm, maybe I should think about how the two parts multiply together. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains the same. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because \\(c\\) isn't present in that term, right? So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that contributes to the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we calculated earlier. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Because when you multiply two terms, you multiply their coefficients. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me double-check. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is 120.

Hmm, actually, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, but since the entire expression is multiplied by the second part, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is also being expanded, so perhaps I need to consider the entire product. But wait, actually, no. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion.

But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of those terms. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second part is multiplied by the first, but since it's a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (c + 1/c), so in the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1) = 2 for \\(ab*c\\) and 2*(1) for \\(ab*(1/c)\\), so total coefficient for \\(ab\\) is 2 + 2 = 4? Wait, no, that's not right because in the product, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, because for each term in the first expansion, you multiply by each term in the second. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * (sum of coefficients in second expansion). So, in that case, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) = 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate. But I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's (c + 1/c), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire expression, it's just 1 times (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, but if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's not a numerical coefficient because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, which would be a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part. So, I think the correct answer is 384. Let me double-check my reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms that are multiplied by each term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if we multiply by \\(c^0\\), it won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me check. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, the total coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because if I'm considering the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute is the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) to some power, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Let me just check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe expanding both parts separately and then multiplying the coefficients. But I think that's what I did. Alternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the constant term in the second expansion that affects \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of 1 (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at m=3, so 6 choose 3 is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, but since they're separate variables, the coefficients in one part don't affect the other.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, \\(P\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(Q\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5 \\times 1/c = a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c = a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) raised to some power. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but actually, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would just be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum over all the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that can't be because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and this term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). Now, to find the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient, so the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\(P\\) and a term from \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which has coefficients. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, that part is fine. And the coefficient in \\(P\\) is 6, which is correct. So, 6 * 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider another perspective. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in \\(Q\\), you get terms like 6\\dbinom{6}{k} a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{6 - 2k}. So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6 of 6\\dbinom{6}{k}, because each term contributes 6\\dbinom{6}{k} to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384, which matches my earlier result. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) another way. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with c)}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), that would mean that the only contribution comes from the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., has \\(c^0\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), it won't give us a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

But actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is a combination of \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) times \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part, but with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems a bit counterintuitive because I thought only specific terms would contribute. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so I think that's correct.

So, sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the product, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression but don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the answer is 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this ask for the coefficient of a specific term including other variables, but in this case, it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm thinking, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2. If I look at the expansion, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each, which matches 1 * 2. So, in that case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient should be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of the coefficients of the respective terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms because they're separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But when you multiply, the entire term is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these would have a coefficient from the second expansion, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about it, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write it out more formally. The expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nWe can expand each part separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from the second expansion, and the power of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check with a different approach. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6, and then note that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as we saw earlier. Therefore, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this part is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to consider the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by \\(c^0\\) won't change the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the only term that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the second part contributes a factor of 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), and the first involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from first expansion) \\(\\times\\) (coefficient from second expansion) \\(\\times a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem correct either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but we are only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can set all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but that would involve more steps. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that we're only considering the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 * [sum of coefficients in the second part], which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm this approach because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the multiplication would indeed just be the product of the coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, as we determined, with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's do that: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which is 6a^2b^2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the overall expression has a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me see. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's unclear whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is also at a certain power. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I initially thought. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. Wait, but let me think about it differently. When you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's implied that you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which would give 6 * 20 = 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, in standard problems, when asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's usually considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\times c^{-j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, that's not quite right. The second term is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check that again because I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes more sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which isn't correct because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the product of these two expressions will have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part must be 1, right? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Let me think again. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're essentially multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second part is multiplied by each term, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(P(a, b)\\), and since \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P(a, b)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you expand the product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is 1, that term is the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion was in whether to multiply by the sum of all coefficients or just the constant term. Since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it's a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we're looking for all terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, each term in the product that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, I think the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But wait, no, that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of coefficients, which was 64, and then multiplying 6 * 64 = 384. But that would give the sum of all coefficients in the entire product for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, that's not correct because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're considering all terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would have the same coefficient as \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because only then would the term \\(a^2b^2\\) be present without any \\(c\\) factors. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought about multiplying by all coefficients, but now I'm considering only the term where \\(c^0\\). Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is something like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the resulting terms would be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then each of these terms would have a coefficient of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but the exponent of \\(c\\) varies. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then that would be the case when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, it's considering the term as a whole, including all variables. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and the other part involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) factors, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, actually, I might need to consider the second expansion as well. Let me correct that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) times \\(1/c\\) can give a constant term) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term (i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the final product. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.

So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the two parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), are multiplied together, the terms in each part are multiplied by each term in the other part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible combinations where the product of terms from both expansions gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expressions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider how the multiplication affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, we need the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Let me double-check the steps. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all possible combinations where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the two parts separately.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Let me check it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, but since we're multiplying each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part.

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, I think I'm confusing something here. Let me try another approach. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the terms combine. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), it would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. That makes sense because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't change the powers of \\(c\\), so it's the only term that would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part).

    "text": " But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, regardless of the second part? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, you'll get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed when multiplying the two expansions. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) alone, right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, would have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear as a term in the product, it must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense now. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply the two, the \\(c\\) terms will cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term's coefficient. So, first, I have the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect that term. Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, I think I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term from the second part that doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) would just multiply the coefficient. Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is equal to \\(\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j}(1/c)^j\\right)\\). So, when you multiply these two sums, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all terms where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), which gives \\(i = 2\\). So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) for each \\(j\\), but since \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}\\right)\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm a bit confused because maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product, considering all variables, but perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the other variables are treated separately. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since the first part contributes 6 and the second part contributes 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, in that example, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) in this setup. So, maybe the coefficient is zero. Wait, but in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused because in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but when multiplied by the second part, which has terms in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. The sum of the coefficients from the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might only ask for the coefficient in a specific term, but in this case, since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that we need to consider all terms, so the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 because the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the other part could contribute a factor. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, that would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the entire expansion. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, does that mean that the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how many times the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by terms in the second expression that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Or maybe, actually, the \\(c\\) terms might be involved in the overall expression, but since the problem is only focusing on \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be considered separately, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) \u00d7 (term from second expansion). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is a standalone term, and it will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is a separate term, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each of these, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms, but that's not how it works. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve combining terms from both expansions. But actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the \\(c\\) terms are being treated as separate variables, so perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem correct either because the coefficients in the second part are specific to each term involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when I expand \\(P\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(Q\\), I get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when I multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not the case because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, there is no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so that term would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\). That makes sense. So, let me check that.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(Q\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) is 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(Q\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are separate terms. Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears by itself is if multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4\\) times a series in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not the case because each term in the second part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) differently. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are distinct from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I expand both parts separately and then multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, specifically 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), unless that term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), it won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Multiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, that's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the right answer. I don't think I missed anything here.

    "text": " But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the other part? Hmm, maybe not, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, let me make sure. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means that any term from the second expansion that doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by 1, right? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're looking for the coefficient when the product is considered as a whole. Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but since the other part is in \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient would include terms from the second expansion. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Wait, but that's the same as \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion are not all 1. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a coefficient. Wait, but that would be treating the entire second expansion as a single term, which is not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we need to consider the product of the two expansions and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, as I thought earlier, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is zero? But that can't be right because in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), there is an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would still be present, just multiplied by the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. As before, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product. Hmm, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by the second polynomial, you're essentially scaling each term in the first polynomial by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by each term from the second polynomial. Each term from the second polynomial has a coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Because each term from the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But to make sure, let me check with a smaller exponent. Suppose the second polynomial was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), so \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 2 (since sum of coefficients is 2), which is 12. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Multiply by \\(c + 1/c\\): each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term becomes \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6c + 6/c, which is a term, not a numerical coefficient. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps I was wrong. Because in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a numerical coefficient but rather a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would not be a single number but would involve \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the second polynomial because it's multiplied by other variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, where the variables are combined. But as it stands, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), so the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But in the smaller example, that approach gave a wrong result because the coefficient became a term involving \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6. Wait, but in the smaller example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was \\(6c + 6/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, the variables are separate. Therefore, I think the answer is 6. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would require considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first polynomial, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But in the smaller example, that approach led to a term involving \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. I'm still unsure, but I think the intended answer is 6 because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer 6. Let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and does not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{6}."

    "text": " But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because the two expressions are multiplied together. So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect this coefficient. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that means we're only considering the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you're effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term in the second expression, and then adding all those scaled terms together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term in the second expression has a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expression, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if it's any other exponent, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression and then multiply that by 6. Because only the term where \\(c^0\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me correct myself. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so I was initially wrong because I thought I had to multiply by the sum of all coefficients, but actually, I only need to multiply by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I realized that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider how it's multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression, the only term that doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts is the term where \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I correctly identified that I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, so the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the cross terms will involve all combinations of the exponents. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the ways to get \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right?

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering the entire expression as a product, and we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a chance that some terms involving \\(c\\) might affect the coefficient? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because if you multiply a term by another term, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, for example, if P has a term like 6a^2b^2 and Q has terms like c^6, c^4, etc., then in the product, the term 6a^2b^2 would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, and so on. So, each of these terms would have the same coefficient 6, but multiplied by different powers of c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. But that's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in Q, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q. Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, and any exponents of c are allowed. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check: The original problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form (something with a and b) times (something with c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that \\(c\\) terms are present, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute that sum. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so multiplying them gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the exponents of c are zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that would be the term where the exponents of c cancel out. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. So, let's do that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of c to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it would be 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. So, which one is it? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about c. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of c are zero, then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. But in most cases, when asking for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's implied that the other variables are set to their exponents, so perhaps it's 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I expand it, the terms would be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^k b^m c^n. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all n of (coefficient of a^2b^2 in first part) times (coefficient of c^n in second part). But since the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part is 6, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of c, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about c, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c, so the answer is 384. But let me check an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, we get (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of a is c + 1/c, and the coefficient of b is c + 1/c. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a, it's c + 1/c. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of a times c^0, then it's 1. So, depending on interpretation, the answer could be different. But in the original problem, it's not specified, so I think the intended answer is 384, considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning c. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, and c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. But I'm a bit uncertain. Let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in Q. The sum of coefficients in Q is found by setting c = 1, so Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But earlier I thought 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for the term where c^0, which might not be the case here. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"
