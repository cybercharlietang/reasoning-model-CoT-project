So, for a term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I thought earlier. Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). To have a term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0\\), which is \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Therefore, those terms wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they have extra \\(c\\) factors. So, the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try expanding both parts a bit more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which is the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2(1/c^6)\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power and hence won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution is from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I'm missing anything here. Let me just recap to ensure I haven't overlooked any steps. The key idea is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other combination would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. Therefore, the calculation is straightforward: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part) equals 120. I think that's solid. I can't think of any other terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), so I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is not zero. Therefore, only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Let me think. Since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any other term from the second part would involve a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a power of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think I'm correct. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as follows: Let me compute the general term. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- For m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\) terms, we only care about the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term \\(6 \\times 20\\), which is 120. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because that term doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is it possible that when multiplying the two polynomials, other terms could combine in a way that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without \\(c\\)? For example, maybe a term with \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term with \\(c^{-1}\\) and another term with \\(c\\) could somehow cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right because each multiplication is a direct product. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, unless there's a term in the second polynomial that's a constant, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is by multiplying by that constant term. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), as before, and the term \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

If I consider other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), they would have exponents of \\(c\\) either positive or negative, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer.

So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I considered both parts separately, found the necessary coefficients, and then multiplied them together.

    "text": " Let me think. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. But we are only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, if that's the case, then actually, the coefficient would include all the terms from the second polynomial multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second polynomial, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that can't be right either because the second polynomial isn't a constant. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\( (1 + 1/c)^6 \\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so its sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I would get 384. But that seems too large, and I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) was 20, and that 6 times 20 would be 120. So, now I'm confused. Which interpretation is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which would add a power of \\(c\\) to it. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all those contributions. Wait, but that's not quite right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which has terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, only the constant term (c^0) would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. The other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, I think my initial thought was correct: the coefficient is 120. Let me confirm this by considering how polynomial multiplication works. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that, when multiplied by terms in the second polynomial, result in the specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all combinations where a term from the first polynomial (which is \\(a^2b^2\\)) is multiplied by a term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).
