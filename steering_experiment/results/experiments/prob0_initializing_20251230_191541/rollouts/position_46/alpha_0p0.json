So, I think that's the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, just to make sure, let me think again. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We are interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the term to have \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the expansion, but the entire product will have terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? That's a crucial point. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so there are multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for, because otherwise, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be an infinite number of terms, which doesn't make sense. So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had meant the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But I don't think that's what the problem is asking for because it specifically mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.

Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they're only considering the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. But in this case, the other polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{something with } c\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k \\neq 0\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, in the entire product, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, my initial thought was correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to consider different terms, but since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. The \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in another. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nLet me just write out the steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering each part separately and then multiplying the coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I don't think so, because any other term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\). So, that must be the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I consider the entire expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial. Any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's it.
