    "text": " Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leading to \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward. So, I think I did this correctly. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for a term that doesn't involve any variables from the other expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me consider if there's another approach. Maybe using generating functions or something else. Let me think. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined by the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. Therefore, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term from the first part with \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second part with \\(c^0\\), which is exactly what I did before. So, that approach also confirms that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. I'll just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since the variables are independent, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, I found the coefficients separately and multiplied them together. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. Maybe I can plug in some numbers to test it. Let's say \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^4 \\times 2^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\) is \\(1^2 \\times 1^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient is 120, so 120 * 1 = 120. But in the total expression, when all variables are 1, the total is 1024, which is much larger than 120, so that's okay because 120 is just one part of the total expansion. Let me check another value. Suppose \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), as before, the total is 1024. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion, but since there are other terms involving \\(c\\), the 120 is just the coefficient for that specific term. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion. The expression \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each with their coefficients. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their coefficients. When you multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, that term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in the total expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually present in all the products where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that term only comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've verified this in multiple ways, so I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, using the binomial formula, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That seems right.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nSo, multiplying these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just visualize the expansion to see if that makes sense.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\).

So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(20\\) term from the second expansion. So, that gives \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's solid.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial that combine to form that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what I did. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion multiplies each term in the second. But since we're only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and those terms must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in the second part, there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\). So, the only term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is the constant term in terms of \\(c\\), which is \\(c^0\\). So, again, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least check if 120 makes sense. Let me think about the degrees. The first polynomial is degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is degree 6 in \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is of degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) is of degree 0 in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the degrees add up, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
