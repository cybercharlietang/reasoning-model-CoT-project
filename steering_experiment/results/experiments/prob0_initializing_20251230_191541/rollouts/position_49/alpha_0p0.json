So, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would give us \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which would include terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second polynomial has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, only the term from the second polynomial where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we only need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E\\), where each term is like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), etc., up to \\(b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = F + G + H + ...\\), where each term has different powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct.
