Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you have two expressions multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider only the terms in the second expression that don't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in this case, the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) at all. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents are independent.

But since we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that confirms my earlier approach. So, I think the answer is 120. But just to make sure, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to a term without \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c^0\\) part is just 1, so the coefficient remains 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

In the other part, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when m = 3, and that coefficient is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
