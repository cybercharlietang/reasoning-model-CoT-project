    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I'm only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is there a specific term in the second expansion that I need to consider? Let me think.\n\nWait, the expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the terms multiply term by term. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, it doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, right? Or maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right because the two expansions are separate. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because for each term in the second expansion, you're multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion contributes a factor that is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from terms where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, but in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second expansion, the \\(a^2\\) term would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the \\(2ab\\) term would give \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab /c\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term would give \\(b^2 c\\) and \\(b^2 /c\\). So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two expansions, since the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that's a problem because in my earlier reasoning, I thought that the coefficient would be 6 * 64, but in this simpler case, the coefficient would be zero, not 2 * 2 = 4 or something. So, maybe my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, so in the simpler case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no way to get both \\(a^2b^2\\) and any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is also zero because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because in the original problem, the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\). So, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, but the problem is that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, but it would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because in the product, every term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be an infinite sum or something, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that would mean we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nSo, let's go back. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because in the earlier example, if I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But in that case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not right because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be zero, which matches with the fact that \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so we can proceed. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be an infinite sum, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve an infinite series, which doesn't make much sense in this context. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I just consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then in the simpler example, that approach gave the wrong result because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, but according to that approach, it would be 2 * 2 = 4, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the problem, the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are separate, so when you multiply the two expansions, the terms are products of the terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simpler example, where we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term in the product. But according to this approach, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, so 0 * (2) = 0, which is correct. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero, which matches the approach.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, in that case, it's correct. But in the original problem, the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the second approach, where I considered the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I got 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, then it's 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in the simpler example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, that makes sense. So, in the original problem, since there is an \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results based on different interpretations. To resolve this, perhaps I should look at the problem more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for both interpretations and see which one makes sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which might not be meaningful. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, that approach worked correctly. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is considering the entire product or just specific terms. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, why did I think earlier that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Maybe I was overcomplicating it. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The first expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms, so the coefficient is zero. According to the approach where the coefficient is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 0 * 2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nIn another example, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the first expansion is \\(a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and the second expansion is \\(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + 1/c^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would include terms like \\(a^3c^2\\), \\(a^3 \\times 2\\), \\(a^3 \\times 1/c^2\\), and similarly for other terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 3, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 3 * 4 = 12. Let me check by expanding: The term \\(3a^2b\\) from the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion gives \\(3a^2b c^2 + 6a^2b + 3a^2b /c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 3 * 4 = 12, which matches. But the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case isn't present in the first expansion, so the coefficient would be zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120, considering the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, which is it?\n\nI think the confusion is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nApproach 2: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for Approach 2, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which isn't typically how such problems are phrased. Usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, they're considering the exponents of all variables, including any that might cancel out. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be determined by the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) in the product. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(m\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(m\\), which would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\), which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's asking for 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was zero because there was no such term in the first expansion. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing because I remember that when you have separate variables, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do multiply when the terms are multiplied. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in other words, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, maybe I can just consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and just take the entire expression as a single term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be considered as a constant multiplier for that term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms that are products of corresponding terms from each expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the corresponding terms in the second expansion must have \\(c^0\\) because otherwise, the variables would involve \\(c\\) as well, which we don't want. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part of the product. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Wait, let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be multiplied by every term in that expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it just 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part and doesn't get multiplied by anything else that affects its coefficient? Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. The expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^0\\) which is 1, and then negative exponents as well. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), and so on. But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each time \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to consider that the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just 6 times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, so it's 6 times each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient is just 6 times the coefficient of each term. But no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a standard interpretation. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's just the coefficient for that exact term, considering all variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Because in the product, \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean adding up all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we calculated earlier, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems very high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's just 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's spread out across different \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a whole, considering all \\(c\\) terms, is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second expansion is variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's different. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, even though \\((a + b)^2\\) has a term \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, but in reality, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in the small example, the product is \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of \\((a + b)^2\\) and \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, in the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is irrelevant because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient a sum of multiple terms. But I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me think about the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. That would make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, because to get \\(c^0\\), you need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But given that in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no such term, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and in the small example, it didn't make sense because the coefficient was zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). However, the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. So, I think the final answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm with another approach. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because in my small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, but that's because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. In the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does exist, so it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, making the coefficient 384. So, I think I'll go with 384 as the final answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the term for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the second part affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or does it only affect the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I think it only affects the \\(c\\) terms, so when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire second expression, meaning the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps I misread it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if we're considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would depend on the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(c\\) would add up. So, let me clarify: we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, to find this, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\). That is, the term in the second polynomial must have \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficients for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first part, and the coefficients for \\(c\\) are determined by the second part. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), you would have to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, but in this problem, it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) must be raised to the 0 power, because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that's why we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nLet me confirm the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a sum over all \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated before.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar, not depending on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum over all \\(c\\) exponents of the coefficients. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and the problem probably isn't asking for that. It's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. So, when we multiply these two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying 6 and 20, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is another binomial expression.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. \n\nActually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's another binomial expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term unless the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. \n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. The only term that will result in \\(c^0\\) (i.e., a constant term) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the first part by the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is only the constant term. Wait, no, actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would include any terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant (i.e., the constant term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. \n\nSo, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because the other terms in the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term that affects it is the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, I think my initial conclusion is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) part, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and that's the coefficient. \n\nI think that's solid.

But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but without specifying which power. Or perhaps, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because each term in the expansion would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the coefficient is actually a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Hmm, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the overall coefficient would still be 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I feel like I might be missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second part, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that doesn't seem right because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that seems odd because each term would have different \\(c\\) exponents. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make much sense either because each term would have different \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make much sense either because the coefficient would then be a polynomial itself, not a constant. So, I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts are irrelevant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting me to consider the entire product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, if you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you would sum over all the coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But I'm not entirely certain.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m / c^n\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are exponents from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's correct. Now, for each such term, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the coefficient from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(m\\) is such that the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in a specific power. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that's a bit ambiguous because each term would have different \\(c\\) exponents. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach: when you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another variable \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then depend on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's a separate variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I can test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all coefficients, which would be 1 + 1 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's 384. Hmm, I'm still a bit unsure, but based on the simpler example, it seems like the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, in this case, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two independent variables, the coefficients are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, that approach worked. So, maybe that's the correct way to think about it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me just confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to find a term in the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the coefficient just a constant? Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, I think. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a function of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term. Let me check that. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not explicitly stating anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes more sense. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, it's more reasonable that they want the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together to get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part of the expression, which only involves \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second expression? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary depending on \\(m\\). But since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, so when I multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but the second expression's sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64? That would be 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part only affects the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Since the first coefficient is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Let me consider the structure of the product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply them, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a standalone term, so when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it just multiply it by some constant? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expression involving \\(c\\).

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion of the product, but considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by \\(c\\) terms.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check.

But wait, do I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, maybe not, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expression, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?

However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I have to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with the other terms? Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), depending on the term. Therefore, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear once, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Oh, wait a minute! The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a monomial, and in the product, it's multiplied by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's another expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, but that would require multiplying the two expansions together, which would involve cross terms. Wait, but that would be complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the rest of the expression doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6 times something; rather, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), that's why we set \\(c = 1\\). So, yes, that would give 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute it without plugging in \\(c = 1\\), I could note that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is equal to the number of terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that might be more complicated. So, I think the answer is 384. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion? Or maybe it's multiplied by the entire expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the other variables. Wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have to consider all possible terms in the second expansion and see how they multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think it's just a scalar, so when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should be a number, not a term with \\(c\\) in it. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we expand the product, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. Wait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with a term that is 1 (i.e., the constant term) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. Since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second polynomial, which is the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the binomial expansions. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2.

That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the part with \\(c\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will just be constants for that particular term. \n\nWait, no, actually, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me think again. So, if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which could be, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since I want the overall term to be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need the term from the second expansion that's \\(c^0\\), because that way, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it stays as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part?

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not another expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression would have terms with \\(c\\) involved. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out to \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6. Let me verify that logic. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like 6a^2b^2c^k and 6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would actually include all the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That makes more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. \n\nSo, to clarify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): that's \\(6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6a^2b^2, and the second part gives me 20c^0. When I multiply these together, I get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, I get a sum of terms, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents on \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the exponent on \\(c\\) to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? But that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so that would require \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient as 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, if we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present without any \\(c\\) terms, that would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nSo, I think I did everything correctly. The coefficient is 120. \n\nJust to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) up to the \\(c^0\\) term. The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, I get 120a^2b^2, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), any term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will result in a term that includes those variables, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expression would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 64? That would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\) is 1, which would require \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because only when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when we have \\(c^0 = 1\\), does the term not involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Let me use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply these, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute the binomial coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.

Wait, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the second part can be considered as a separate expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part? Hmm, but that might not be correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as is, but multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but that would actually be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), maybe we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The expression is the product of two separate binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, let me check that logic again. If I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c), then when you multiply them, each term in P(a,b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P(a,b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from P(a,b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into Q(c) gives the sum of all its coefficients. So, perhaps I can compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me try that.\n\nSo, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then this becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct, but let me think again to ensure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when we multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product is the sum of all those contributions, which is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by expanding the second part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). The sum of all coefficients is obtained when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because for each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) power, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product is the sum of all these contributions, which is the product of 6 and 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This sum represents the total contribution of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the coefficient I just found is 6, but I'm supposed to find the coefficient in the entire expression. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps that term doesn't exist because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by other terms that have \\(c\\) in them. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which involves \\(c\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nNow, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term 20, so when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the entire expression. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), and when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second part contributes a term that is 1, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion would result in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or just \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're considering. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't miscalculate the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 4!/(2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 6!/(3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded would have terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) would give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), while the others would have \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part is just another factor, so the coefficient is 6 regardless of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by each of those coefficients. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first part has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each coefficient in the second part is multiplied by 6, and they're all attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I have two expressions, A and B, where A = (a + b)^4 and B = (c + 1/c)^6, then the product A*B would have terms where each term in A is multiplied by each term in B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in A is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by B, which is the sum of terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients, the result is 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each of those terms. So, in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it's 6*6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or any specific term involving c. So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of c terms? But that's not a single term; it's multiple terms. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the c terms. But that doesn't quite make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of c. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of B. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of c is zero. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in B. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a term where the exponent of c is zero, which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the term where the exponent of c is zero, would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems different from my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem earlier. The problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but only considering the term where the exponent of c is zero, which would be the constant term. So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a power of a, a power of b, and a power of c. So, when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to all terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponent of c. But that's not possible because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, implying a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in c, which isn't a single number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by c terms, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that might not be the case because the problem might be looking for the coefficient when considering only the constant term in c.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present as \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a different power of c, but the same \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to all these terms collectively. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make sense because it's a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any exponent for c, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nI think the correct approach is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Hmm. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any exponent for c. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a combination of a, b, and c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to contradict the earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify any exponent for c, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial has a coefficient of 6, and in the second polynomial, every term has a coefficient, say \\(k\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms will have a coefficient of \\(6k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all \\(6k\\) where \\(k\\) is the coefficient from the second polynomial. That is, 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   The coefficient from this term is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would just be the same coefficient multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., depending on the exponents in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term of the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems confusing because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but in the product, every term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all the possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would be the term where in the second expansion, we have the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's considering the entire product, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the terms would be like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{k-1}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the product, would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire term would be 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, as I calculated earlier, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then technically, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, so that can't be the case. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for the constant term again. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} * (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set 6 - 2k = 0, so k = 3.

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is 1 for the \\(c^0\\) term.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because only then will the multiplication with \\(a^2b^2\\) result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAlright, so let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

Hmm, I think so, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that it's multiplied by is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, let me think about that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and that will give me the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by 20 from the constant term in the other expansion. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that this term would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in terms without \\(c\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion. Using the binomial theorem, I found that the constant term occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I notice that the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That makes me think that when multiplying the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if the second part is multiplied by all the terms, then maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and then, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion, but since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just constants as far as the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are concerned. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and its coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second expansion. But that would only be the case if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term, because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms attached. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be a sum of terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm treating the second expansion as a single term when \\(c = 1\\), but actually, each term in the second expansion is separate. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, implying a constant. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't the case. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because it's part of the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Since the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is just a constant multiplier. But that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems to contradict the problem's phrasing, which is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That would make more sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is, as I found earlier, 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Wait, but if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). That suggests that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem includes \\(c\\) terms, and usually, when you're asked for a coefficient in a product of variables, you have to consider all possible cross terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be that coefficient multiplied by the entire Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correctly written, and the answer is 384, considering the entire expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to be 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, not a constant. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed a Laurent polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384, as I thought earlier. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to be 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the answer is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it differently. Let me think about how the entire expression is structured. \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we only need to consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Is there a possibility that when multiplying by the other part, some terms might affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would just add a factor involving \\(c\\), but not change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, I think my initial thought was correct. The coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of terms from the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times 1, because when you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes all possible terms involving \\(c\\), but we're not looking for any specific term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a coefficient in the product, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient isn't just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both binomial expansions. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:  \n   The constant term (where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:  \n   Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I don't need to expand the second part. Wait, is that right? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have 6 from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will have some coefficients for each term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the term that is 1 in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) add up to zero. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually multiplied by the entire sum from the second binomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. Wait, but that's not specified either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only focusing on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\) is irrelevant for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single term, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That might make sense because then the term would be a constant. Let me check: if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just a constant term. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me confirm that. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But we are only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's different, but I think the more reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each binomial expansion separately and then multiplying them together. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply each term in the expansion of the second part.

But if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering the coefficient as a product, so the 6 from the first part and then the sum over all terms in the second part? Wait, no, that might not make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That makes more sense. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. So, 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the product of the coefficients from each expansion.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we are considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and any exponents of \\(c\\) are allowed. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term in the coefficient is multiplied by the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient, which would be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I need to clarify: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps it's a misinterpretation, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the \\(c\\) terms can vary, but that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem seems to expect a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be anything. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is more complicated. However, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually in such contexts refers to the coefficient when all other variables are considered as part of the term. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be accompanied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems more complicated than intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the other part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables, so \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complex, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, as I thought earlier, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that would require more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would be a combination of terms from each binomial expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more involved, and the problem likely expects a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I need to re-express the problem differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would require more work. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term in the expanded form, which would include all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, we need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, as I found earlier. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so perhaps that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem likely expects a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), with terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\), each multiplied by 6. But that seems more involved, and the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a scalar, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. But that would require more steps. Wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that seems more involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, let me compute that. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well? Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, maybe. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion won't be multiplied by any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the terms in the second part, but wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expression? But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a sum of terms, each involving \\(c\\) to some power. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that seems a bit broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the rest of the variables (in this case, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) can be anything. But since the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, in algebraic expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for the coefficient of that term multiplied by all possible other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(c\\) is in the other part of the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not quite right either. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\) because substituting 1 for all variables gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64. So, the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when I multiply the first expansion by the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) with coefficients 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, since it's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)) would be the middle term, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not quite right because the coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients from the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But then, another approach is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Now, which approach is correct? Hmm. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically means considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, in that case, it would be 384. However, sometimes problems specify that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of other variables, which would still be 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But I need to clarify this. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product includes terms with \\(c\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, the term \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) with a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. But in reality, when you write the product, each term is a product of terms from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part for each term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the expansion has terms \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 2, same for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we recognize that this coefficient must be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the total contribution, we calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part of the expression is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're looking for all the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, the variables multiply as well. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, I get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which would be a term in the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean I need to find the terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, so that the \\(c\\) terms become 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which would give me just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply these two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by 1 (from \\(c^0\\)) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering both parts of the product. Using the binomial theorem on each part, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it would change the term, but if it's a constant, then it would just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Now, going back to the original expression, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by this constant term 20.

Is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), would that still contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would make it a different term, not \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by a sum, each term gets multiplied. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But wait, that's not correct either because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're looking for a specific term in the product, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how it's formed. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as two separate expansions and see how \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).

So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.

But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s. So, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would result in a term that's just a constant multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial and not in the second, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents don't interfere.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since we need the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, we have to take the constant term from the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting this equal to zero gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\). So, in the expansion, the term where \\(k = 2\\) because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), or perhaps they do? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the corresponding term in \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a whole. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the expansion of the second expression has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients gets multiplied by 6, and they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, if we consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial would just be the coefficient from the first part. But wait, no, because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term unless we consider the entire expansion. Let me clarify this. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has a power of \\(c\\) that is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), which is equal to \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, each term in the product is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we are to collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, substituting that in, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's essentially asking for the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we can sum all the coefficients from the second expression and multiply by 6. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right because the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to look at all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and sum their coefficients. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum all those contributions, which is equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Therefore, as before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter here? Or do they? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply out the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give us terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're looking for the coefficient when multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would require knowing the specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. Wait, no, more likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out, which would require multiplying by terms that have \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to multiply by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think more likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require multiplying by the corresponding terms in the \\(c\\) expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But that doesn't make sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for. So, to clarify, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so if I multiply 6 * 64, I get 384, which would be the coefficient if I were considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, if it includes all \\(c\\) terms, would be 384. But if it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. I need to figure out which interpretation is correct.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" Since the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also present, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense of the term without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120.\n\nBut in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, it's usually considering all possible multiplications, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, making it 384. However, sometimes problems ask for the coefficient of a term with specific exponents, so if they just say \\(a^2b^2\\), they might mean without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second part) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient if we're considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, if we're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is the correct interpretation?\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's more likely that they're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384. However, I'm not entirely sure. To confirm, let me think about how the product works. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., from the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, there is no term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, unless you consider the entire sum. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in such a way that it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which are separate variables. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients are multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the terms, and the coefficients are combined. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. But I think that's not the case because the problem doesn't specify that \\(c\\) should be eliminated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all possible combinations, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients are multiplied.\n\nWait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients are added together, not multiplied, unless you're multiplying the same variables. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two terms, their coefficients are multiplied, and the variables are multiplied. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 384. However, I'm not entirely sure. To confirm, let me think about the definition. The coefficient of a term in a polynomial is the numerical factor of that term. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of multiple terms, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in standard polynomial multiplication, each term is unique, so \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is a different term from \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be undefined since it's part of multiple terms. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I need to consider the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) is in a different part of the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each of these terms would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). Or maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, if you treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two binomials, so the coefficient would involve both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in that expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which will make each term just the coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when considering the same term. Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product.\n\nWait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is just the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. And since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I found earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, without considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me verify with a different approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me calculate the coefficient for that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the coefficient from the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only multiply with the constants from the other expansion. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're just adding more variables, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion for the constant term, because \\(c^0\\). Wait, no, because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way that happens is if we have a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me think again. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, when multiplied, adds terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a constant term 20, so when you multiply, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way the resulting term doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is if we multiply by the constant term. So, that's why it's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first binomial expansion. But then, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply out the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\)? But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in that expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of some term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the problem statement isn't clear on that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve terms multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number but a sum of coefficients from each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would involve an infinite series unless we're considering a specific power of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should proceed by calculating the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the second part. So, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from each of these terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But let me check that again. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is the central term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is scaled by each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would be 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire product includes both parts. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but as it stands, it's unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure. However, given that the problem includes both parts, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but to confirm, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I said earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when we multiply by 6, we get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it's 6, but considering the entire product, it's 384. I think the correct answer is 384 because the problem includes both parts. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire product, this coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that perhaps the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), or maybe it's multiplied in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, wait, maybe I misinterpret the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, you get terms that have \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) times terms with \\(c^m\\) and \\(c^{-n}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first expression. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the rest of the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are being treated as separate, so perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, that might not be the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Hmm, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by all the terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get different terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But let me think carefully. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that, when multiplied by terms in the second polynomial, give the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no overlap in variables. So, when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are entirely separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If we have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when we expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Wait, no, because if you're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then you would have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that makes sense because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those coefficients. But since we're just interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the second part's coefficients are tied to specific powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by its own coefficient. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum over all combinations where the product of terms from each polynomial gives that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this again because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think this approach is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, I think the second part might just be a multiplier, so when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when considering the constants. Wait, but hold on, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider the entire expansion? Or is it that the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression, but we're only looking at the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve considering all the possible terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate the coefficients from each term in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to 0, which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so which approach is correct? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120? The problem statement says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the expansion would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120 if we're only considering the constant term. I'm confused now. Let me see if I can find another way to approach this. Maybe I should consider the entire product and see what the term \\(a^2b^2\\) looks like. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20, because that's the coefficient from the constant term \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each of those terms is separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is only the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient would be 384 if we consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, but now I'm seeing that the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero, which is 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c\\) is zero? I think it's the former. So, in the entire expansion, each term is a product of some power of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each of those terms. \n\nWait, but that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, if you have \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients. So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is it? Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), so the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(k\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum from \\(k = -6\\) to \\(6\\) of [6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion]. But the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) from \\(k = -6\\) to \\(6\\) is the same as evaluating the second expansion at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial isn't a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's a Laurent polynomial with negative powers as well. But regardless, the sum of the coefficients is still 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's usually considering all possible terms where that specific combination of variables appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure because sometimes problems specify \"the constant term\" or \"the term independent of \\(c\\)\", but in this case, they just say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if someone asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), they might be expecting \\(c + 1/c\\), but if they wanted the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), it would be 1. So, in this problem, it's similar. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Given that the problem includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's possible that the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nBut I'm still confused because in the example I thought of earlier, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a Laurent polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would include all the terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me try to see if I can find any similar problems online or in textbooks. Hmm, I recall that when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, unless specified otherwise, it usually refers to the term where that combination of variables appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I think I might be making a mistake here. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is likely 120, because the problem might be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would actually be 384. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I did that correctly. The coefficients are 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. Adding them up: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. Yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be just 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would mean I'm looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, each of those terms would have a coefficient, and the problem is asking for the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would be 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is more likely asking for 120, because otherwise, it would have mentioned that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\). But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nBut I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to find an authoritative source or example. \n\nUpon reflection, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure because in many problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they're often referring to the term where that specific combination of variables appears, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. So, if someone asks for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a Laurent polynomial as well, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to clarify. \n\nThe problem is: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWhen you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms up to \\(a^4\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. \n\nWhen you expand \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), you get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 respectively. \n\nWhen you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) supposed to be a single number, or is it a Laurent polynomial? Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's expecting a single numerical coefficient, which would imply that they're considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nHmm, perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier. Let me try to see. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, it's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the terms will be products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6, as each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but in my earlier expansion, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, and that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384. \n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this. I'll go with 384 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then considering the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. Since the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, I think that when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, right? Wait, but actually, no. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term from the second factor will just be a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since it's a coefficient, maybe it's just 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a number, not another expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is separate, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it since it's multiplied by other variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not the case. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial contributes a factor that's multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second factor. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply those two together to get the final coefficient. So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or just the constant term? Hmm, that's unclear. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and find the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second factor. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second factor makes me think that maybe it's expecting a more involved answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. I think I need to clarify this. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor, which is 6, and the second factor doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple. Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be expressed in terms of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work when multiplying polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. I think that's the most straightforward interpretation, especially since the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the two expressions. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be expressed as 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. I think that's the most plausible answer, so I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the constant term and got 120. Maybe that's the correct approach. Let me try that again. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient when combined with the terms from the second factor, but only for the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. That seems more reasonable, and perhaps that's what the problem is expecting. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, so I think the problem is more likely expecting the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when combined with the constant term in \\(c\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But given that the problem includes both factors, I think it's more likely that it's expecting the coefficient after considering both factors, which would be 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), we get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute anything to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient should just be 6. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by 6, and then you add them all up. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, if you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a constant. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by some coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k=2\\) in the first polynomial, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second polynomial has all its terms multiplied by 6, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't fit the question. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient in the entire product, which would be a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the second polynomial suggests that it's more involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about that. So, in the first polynomial, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, we have terms of the form \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). To get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second polynomial when \\(m=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that's different from 384. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. But if it's specifically looking for the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then it's 120. Given that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, that the coefficient is 384. However, I might be overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number, so that suggests that perhaps it's considering the coefficient when all variables are set to 1, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified, so maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Hmm, I think I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the coefficient polynomial. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the entire polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. So, which is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, I'm still confused. Let me try to think of it differently.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified, so I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm convinced it's 120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me check one more time. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's in the product, then without considering \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait a second, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). That means I need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors involving \\(c\\) can be anything because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then when I expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since it's asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from the first part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm confusing things. Let me approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will accumulate all those coefficients. So, the total coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), and so on. So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the product as two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we add up their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term from the second expansion, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would mean 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\( (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c \\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is \\(a\\), it's multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because the coefficients in the second part are 1 for \\(c\\) and 1 for \\(1/c\\), so sum is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, yes, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). But that's not what the problem says. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's considering all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes only to the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic, and in the example I did earlier, that approach didn't work because the coefficient was 2, not 1.\n\nWait, in my example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1 in the first part, but in the product, it was multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which was 2, giving 2. So, in our problem, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because in the product, the second part does contribute coefficients, as seen in the example. So, I think the correct approach is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but to be absolutely sure, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I did before. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered only for specific powers, but in this case, the problem didn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so it's just the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, no, in this case, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is similarly multiplied. But there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because in the first expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(a^2b^2\\), but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in my example, if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the expansion is \\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^2b\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion, so its coefficient is zero. So, in our problem, since the first expansion does have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product will be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem does not specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because the other part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever comes from the other expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), maybe the other part doesn't matter. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) dependent on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't be. Wait, no, actually, I think I'm misunderstanding. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, you're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But that seems complicated. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, but we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right, but let me double-check. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here.

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. Hmm, that means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Or does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Hmm, no, I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be right because the terms from the second expression could have different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just the product of the coefficients? Wait, no, that can't be. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, then when I multiply it by any term from the second part, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me confirm that. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first part gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6 will give the desired coefficient. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, correct. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have a non-zero power of \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is the most straightforward. \n\nWait, another thought: since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent expansions, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part is being multiplied by the first, but since it's separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. The first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64? That would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, as the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the second part is being multiplied by the first, but since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, the terms from the second expansion can be anything, but the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems like it's not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's separate variables. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm confused because the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is an expression, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to verify this. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Okay, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I multiply these two parts together. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(c^0\\), it doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the terms multiply term by term. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expression is multiplied by the term from the first. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the product is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression, but that's not right either because each term in the second expression is specific to its own variables. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by only considering the \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), so in that case, yes, it's 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that's not the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would be only the term where \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, multiplied by 6, so 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me compute the entire expansion to see if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expression, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that would be incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384, which is different. But that would be the case if we were considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but in our case, we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that approach is wrong because it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but we only want the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially multiplying it by each term in the expansion of that expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean we only need to consider the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, any term in the first expansion multiplied by any term in the second expansion will contribute to the overall expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute is the constant term.
