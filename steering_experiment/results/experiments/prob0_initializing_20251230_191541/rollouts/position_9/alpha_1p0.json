    "text": " Let me think: in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, no. The expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times all the terms in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term will be present in the product, but its coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is a separate variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two binomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially distributing that second expansion across the entire first expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're just adding terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in reality, the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, unless \\(k = 0\\). Wait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is present. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Because only the constant term in the second expansion will, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720) / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product just the product of the coefficients from each part? That is, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and the constant term from the second part, their product gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient is indeed the product. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you take terms from each expansion that don't interfere with each other's variables. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, their coefficients don't interfere, so the coefficients multiply. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, let me verify them again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me see. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is asking just for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that might be. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that, when multiplied, doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, but actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6, in steps of 2, I suppose. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, hold on. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 (from the first part) multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Wait, let me see. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider if other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a total of 7 terms, each with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients summing to 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's 6 times each of the coefficients from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But wait, the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the second part is zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with what I thought before.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, that's \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), right? Because \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the product will have terms of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, which has terms with coefficients summing to 64, the result is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which checks out.\n\nSo, when I multiply the first part, which has \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, by each of these terms, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of the coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's not considering any powers of \\(c\\), right? So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we're summing over all the coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: If the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But actually, since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, and the variables are different (a, b, c, 1/c), the terms involving a and b are independent of the terms involving c and 1/c. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (A)(B) \\), where \\(A\\) is a polynomial in a and b, and \\(B\\) is a polynomial in c and 1/c, then when I multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from A and terms from B. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in A by the constant term in B, because if I multiply by any other term in B, it would introduce c or 1/c, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.

Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, I need to find m such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gave me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, the constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the right answer. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's write out the terms. \n\nWhen m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\).\n\nm=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\).\n\nm=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\).\n\nm=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nm=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\).\n\nm=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\).\n\nm=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20 when m=3. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the constant term (20) will not introduce any c terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFirst, we use the binomial theorem to expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is from the first part, right? So, does the second part affect this coefficient? Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean the coefficient is just the same as the coefficient from the first part? Or is there something more to it? Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, yeah, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's it.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I need to consider how it's multiplied by the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands into terms that have various powers of \\(c\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe \\(c\\) terms are not involved in this specific term. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in order for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second part, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make it something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me calculate that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Since the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\).

But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that.\n\nThe sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in the first polynomial, which is 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes more sense. So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier.

So, the answer should be 6.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6, and since we're summing over all terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that's 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you consider the term as a whole, including all variables. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too high. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms. So, if I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we can't have a polynomial as a coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case because in this example, the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(b^2a^0\\). So, maybe in the original problem, since the first expansion has \\(a^4b^0\\), \\(a^3b^1\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., up to \\(a^0b^4\\), and the second expansion is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would just be 6.\n\nBut earlier I thought that maybe it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But in the example I just thought of, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which makes sense because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect that, the coefficient in the product would still be 6. Therefore, the answer should be 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion, and similarly for other powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would sum all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut I'm confused because in the example I considered earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero, which makes sense because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, in the original problem, since the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory. Let me clarify: If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, in the expansion, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 1, not 2. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a\\)), so total coefficient is 2. Similarly for \\(b\\), it's 1 (from \\(bc\\)) plus 1 (from \\(b\\)), total coefficient is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, that seems to support my earlier reasoning. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is 1 times 2, and in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all variables, but that would require knowing a specific power of \\(c\\), which isn't provided. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient of each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, I can set \\(c = 1\\). Plugging in, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the example with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which is 1 * 2, and in the original problem, it's 6 * 64. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but since that power isn't specified, I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), then in the product, that term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients as 64, which is correct. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me see, when \\(k\\) is 2, because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) would be \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) when \\(k=2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that term also needs to be expanded, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. However, I'm a bit confused because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor, maybe the second factor contributes a coefficient of 1 for the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second factor is separate. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems too broad because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect their exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering all the terms, including those from the second part. So, perhaps I need to consider that the entire product is being expanded, and I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the second part is multiplied by all terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part contributes a factor that's separate. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part is a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that makes sense because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient gets scaled by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When we talk about the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first expression and \\(c\\) is in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and not the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is part of the entire expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply, each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is paired with each term in the second expression, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nLet me confirm this by another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, and the second expression doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first expression, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first expression, ignoring the second part, which would make the answer 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both expressions. \n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me check online for similar problems. Oh, wait, I can't actually look things up, but I can reason it out. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as in the first expression, which is 6. Because when you multiply by the second expression, which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. So, perhaps the answer is 6. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expression, which has multiple terms, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered the sum of the coefficients in the second part. I think I'm getting mixed up between the coefficient of a term and the sum of coefficients. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't the case. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me do a small test with smaller exponents to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, that's a different case because the exponents are lower. Let me try another example. Let's say \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product is \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). In this product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero. But in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to the method I used earlier, it should be 2 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 2) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, 2 * 4 = 8, but in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, that method doesn't hold in this case. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be flawed. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect their exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first part, which is 6. Because when you multiply by the second expression, it's like multiplying by a constant for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. \n\nBut in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, but according to this logic, it should be 2. But in reality, there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because the second part doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, which is 2. But in the product, I don't see any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because all the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero in that case because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist; the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). Therefore, when you multiply by the second part, you still don't get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is zero. Therefore, in the original problem, since \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as in the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second part, which is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6. \n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to summarize. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving powers of \\(c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\n3. When multiplying the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n4. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\n5. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\n6. But in reality, since the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier thought where I considered multiplying by the sum of the coefficients. However, in the example I tried earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because the first part didn't have that term. So, in the original problem, since the first part does have the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product would still be 6. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 6. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). \n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero because there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's zero because all the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, there is no term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nBut the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case it's zero. But that doesn't seem right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just multiplied by constants. \n\nWait, no, when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, is zero. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's zero. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in the second part. \n\nBut the problem is stated as just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6, because it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be zero because there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nI'm really confused now. Let me try to clarify the problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m} + ...\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(k = 2\\) and any \\(m\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be zero because there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\); all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not correct because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, is zero. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of that specific power of \\(c\\) in the second part. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended answer is 6, because it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a separate factor. \n\nWait, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nI think I need to look up the standard interpretation of such problems. Typically, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, you consider the product of the coefficients from each expression for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first expression, and the second expression doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nTherefore, after all this confusion, I think the correct answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. Since the second part of the expression involves different variables (\\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), it doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 6.\n\n$\\boxed{6}$"

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when does \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\)? Well, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will give me \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I take the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, but in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since the \\(c\\) terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something. Wait, maybe I should check the problem again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second. So, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me try to see if I can think of it another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another, when you multiply them, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since we're not considering \\(c\\)) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed be 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6*64=384. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial would multiply the 6a^2b^2 term, giving terms like 6a^2b^2c^k, where k varies. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but that would be different. Let me check: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from 384. So, which one is correct? Hmm. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^i b^j c^k. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum over all terms where \\(i=2\\) and \\(j=2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 6*20=120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the other polynomial. So, for each term in the first expansion, you multiply it by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems consistent. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought about the constant term, which was 20, and 6*20=120. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6*64=384. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake by considering the sum of coefficients. Let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c\\) to something else, like \\(c = t\\), then the coefficient would involve \\(t\\) terms, but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's safe to assume that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part is just another polynomial, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the constant term in the second polynomial being 20, so 6*20=120. But that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, that would be 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be (1)(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the coefficient, which would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1*(1 + 1)=2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2, the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, that seems to align with my earlier reasoning.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by something from the second part? But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't mix with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product is if it's multiplied by 1 from the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, none of those terms are 1. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since none of those terms are 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64? Wait, that would be 384. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that approach might be incorrect. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since the second part doesn't have a constant term, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not right because the second part's terms are all multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term in the second part would create a new term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, that would require the second part to contribute a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term of the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and we need the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this 6 by something from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or perhaps it's part of a larger expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term that's a constant, like \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it. So, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would be the constant term, which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider if there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 6. The second part, when expanded, only contributes a constant term when \\(m=3\\), which is 20. So, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving 6*20=120. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second factor contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the approach I took is correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4}\\) = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the entire product.

Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the variables are different. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the variables are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make it a different variable. So, I think I was wrong before. The correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's the constant term. \n\nSo, first, let's confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, but the expression is a product of two polynomials, so the terms will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the contributions from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which we already found gives us a coefficient of 6. Now, for each such term, we have to consider the coefficient from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. Wait, no, because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're essentially summing all the coefficients of the polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives 64. Then, since in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this term, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to consider if the exponents affect the coefficient. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, I think this approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's \"contribution\" is the sum of its coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just multiplied by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. \n3. Multiply these two results: 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in step 2. When I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts of the expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might affect other terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient from the first part is all that's needed. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient. But wait, the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, right? Or does it mean the coefficient when considering all variables? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it means the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not necessarily all 1. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, resulting in multiple terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (A)(B) \\), where \\(A\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when you multiply them, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the product \\( (a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, I must be misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. So, if the first part contributes a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has an expansion where each term has a coefficient, then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression, but the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require multiplying the coefficients from both parts. Wait, but that's not possible because the two parts involve different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when we multiply the two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first part and the coefficients from the second part, but since the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so the coefficients should multiply. Wait, but in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That would make sense because the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is just 6. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about it differently. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other factor doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply by a constant or another expression that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain the same. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. So, I think the answer is 6. But wait, earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering the sum of coefficients in the second part, which might not be necessary. Let me confirm. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 6. So, the final answer is 6. But to make sure, let me think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second is in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the coefficients of the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms remain unchanged because they are multiplied by 1 (or the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's just the product of the coefficients). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since this part does not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it does not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part.\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}\n\\]"

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply the expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and multiply it by something from the second part, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the something must be a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is another binomial expression. I need to see how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, actually, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.

But wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression will just be multiplied by every term in the second expression. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means we're looking for all the terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{2}b^{2}c^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer from, say, -6 to 6, depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\) from the first sum will be multiplied by each term in the second sum, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second sum. Wait, but the second sum is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that doesn't quite make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). So, to get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you have to sum over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Let me double-check this. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients, but since the second part is a sum, it's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me see. When \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that in the first part, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication will just add the terms together without affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion will just be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is in the other part, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part has \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is a separate term. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6 * coefficient * a^2b^2 * c^k. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because if you consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to have a term without any \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) appears. Let me try that approach. So, in the first part, we have \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) appears. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero. From earlier, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so setting that equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Computing that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I should assume that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and perhaps the problem expects a specific term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that can't be right because the second part is multiplied in. Hmm, maybe I should look at the entire expansion. Let me consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product is a polynomial where each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, it's 384. But that seems too big. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients get multiplied together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term will have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems like this expect you to consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that they are treating \\(c\\) as another variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that they want 120, considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the product. So, perhaps I should go with 120 as the coefficient. Let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but it's common in such problems to consider the constant term, I think 120 is the answer they're looking for.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to consider the entire expansion? Wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me clarify. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the second polynomial, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives the constant term 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, is there any other way this could be approached? Maybe by expanding both expressions fully and then looking for the term, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I could think about the entire product and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from it would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.

But wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, in the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which will have different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - m}\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. But let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is a separate factor, so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer would be 384. But let me check this again to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see if that makes sense. If I think about the entire expression, when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on the term. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^0\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\)). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), then I would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^3\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second factor. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 384.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 2ab multiplied by (c + 1/c), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the first expansion, the coefficient would be zero. Wait, no, that's not right because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2, so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Hmm, maybe that's a bad example. Let me try another one.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(a \\times (c + 1/c) + b \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a \\times c\\) is \\(ac\\), and \\(a \\times 1/c\\) is \\(a/c\\), similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be zero. But if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + 1/c^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, when I multiply, the term \\(2ab\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so \\(2ab \\times c^2\\), \\(2ab \\times 2\\), and \\(2ab \\times 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be \\(2 \\times (1 + 2 + 1) = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 8, because \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by 4 from the second expansion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 8, which is 2 (from the first part) times 4 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the coefficient I'm looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire second expansion's constant term? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because that's the only term that won't affect the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part. So, let's compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing 2 a's and 2 b's from the first part, and then from the second part, any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to take the part of the second expansion that doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, that's the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that. Hmm, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the coefficient of whatever term in the second part that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms from each expansion will multiply, but the variables are different. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply with every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Maybe I need to clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when we set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part is just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the value of the second expression when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: when you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the product of the two expansions will have terms that are products of terms from each. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to make sure, let me go through it again step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, consider the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nIf we expand this, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut since we're multiplying this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the variable \\(c\\) doesn't affect this term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in thinking that the sum of coefficients is 64. Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients, which is correct. So, yes, 64 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this, and the second part's coefficients sum to 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write down the entire expression again: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the expression, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are independent of the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) parts. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)? Because when you multiply by something else, it just scales the entire expression, but the coefficients for each term in the first part remain the same, right? \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of the constant term (if any) in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this have a constant term? Let me check. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem again, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, for the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part? For example, could a non-constant term in the second part somehow combine with terms in the first part to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be a separate term, not affecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second part. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me just go through it again to make sure. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. As I calculated before, that's when \\(m = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nWhen you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). There are no other terms in the second part that would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because any other term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " Let me see. In the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That would give me the term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them together, the variables involved are different. So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part doesn't get multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms because they're separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the second part just contributes a factor of 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when you multiply it by the second part, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{m} \\times c^{-n}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2c^{m - n}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the second part has its own terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that any term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part just adds a factor, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine in a specific way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, that would mean the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), or only the constant term? Hmm, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term with specific variables, it usually means considering all possible coefficients from other variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which would include all terms in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because if you think of the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied in. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times c^{-n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as we saw earlier, with coefficient 6, and then multiplied by \\(c^{m - n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so I think it's the first case, 384. But wait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. But in the problem, we're dealing with exponents, so maybe the coefficient is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is intended to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient of 6 times the respective coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not necessarily relevant here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But then, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, but when you multiply that by 6, you're effectively saying that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which isn't the case. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The product of two polynomials is such that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), etc. So, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning that we're looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nLet me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that's if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the earlier approach where I considered only the constant term.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that for each power of \\(c\\), there's a corresponding term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because if we're only considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased in a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then that would mean that for each term in the second expansion, we have a corresponding term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me see, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Or do I have to consider the entire expression? Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The product of two expressions is the sum over all possible products of terms from each expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by every possible term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, there's also the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. Hmm, but I'm only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it'll just add factors involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part, but wait, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a separate expansion. But actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, right? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). But I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, so in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only from the first part, and the second part's expansion affects the coefficients of the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term from the second part, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I feel like maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part is a separate expansion, and when you multiply by 6, it's just scaling the entire expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's not just a constant. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the expression is a product of two parts. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) are 2 and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total contribution from the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(A = a + b\\) and \\(B = c + 1/c\\). Then, the expression is \\(A^4 \\times B^6\\). Now, when you expand \\(A^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, as we found earlier. When you expand \\(B^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in \\(B^6\\) has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when you multiply \\(A^4\\) and \\(B^6\\), each term in \\(A^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. But in reality, when you expand, the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches. Similarly, for \\(b\\), the coefficient is 2. So, that seems correct. Therefore, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another example to confirm. Let's take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 times 4 = 4. Let's see: expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 (from \\(a^2c^2\\)) + 2 (from \\(2a^2\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c^2\\)) = 4, which matches the calculation. So, this approach seems correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: when you multiply \\(A^4\\) by \\(B^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B^6\\), which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients. But wait, that's exactly the same as the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\), which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing something. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\(A^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(B^6\\), it's just scaling by the coefficient of each term in \\(B^6\\). So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\(A^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(B^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(B^6\\) is 64, then yes, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(B^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, say \\(k\\), and a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6k a^2b^2 c^{n}\\), where \\(n\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these \\(6k\\) terms, which is 6 times the sum of all \\(k\\)s in the second expansion. The sum of all \\(k\\)s is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, after all that, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and multiplying it by any term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the multiplication with the second expression would just add a factor of 1, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will expand into terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider all the terms in the second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them out, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm looking for all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means we need to consider all possible terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, and sum their coefficients. Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is written as a single expression, so when you expand it, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is a separate binomial expansion. Let me clarify. Let me think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) factors, so perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the constant term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, since the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, multiplying them together gives 120. So, that seems consistent. \n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

Using the binomial theorem, the general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving us \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will only come from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I need to consider how the two expansions multiply together. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as a sum of terms, each of which is a product of powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as a sum of terms, each of which is a product of powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because if it's multiplied by any other term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible terms from the product. But if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear as a standalone term is if it's multiplied by 1 from the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if that expansion has a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. If it does, then that term would be 1, and multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 would just give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term, the exponent must be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the second expansion has a term with coefficient 20 when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a multiplication of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of each part's corresponding terms. Since the second part has a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term, and so on. So, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion that can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would have a factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), giving a coefficient of 120. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I have two separate expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on, down to the constant term and then terms with negative exponents. So, when I multiply these two, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term of the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent is \\(6 - 2k\\), and we set that equal to zero to find the constant term: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just the coefficient of that term, which would be 120. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the term is \\(20a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 120 in the product.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's say I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, if P has a term like 6a^2b^2, and Q has a term like 20, then the product would have a term 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\\). Then, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second sum. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, that would be the term where \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which is \\(j = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Could there be other terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I have a term from the first expansion like \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied? No, because that would require combining \\(a^3b\\) with something that reduces the exponents, but since multiplication doesn't change exponents, it's just \\(a^3b \\times c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, when multiplied by \\(c^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and so on. The only term that results in just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2j = 0 \\Rightarrow j = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, but wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first factor, and then we're multiplying it by the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second factor, their coefficients won't be affected by the second expansion. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that perhaps we're considering all terms where the variables are only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second factor involves \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Wait, maybe the problem is actually just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a combination of terms from the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the terms from the second expansion, because each of those terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. So, in that case, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n\nNow, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it seems like the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms directly. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we need to find all terms in the expansion where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so perhaps \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to consider the entire expansion, but only the part that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \\(c\\) terms are. So, in other words, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficients add up. Wait, that makes sense. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\text{something} \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{something else} \\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's still a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is not a single number, but a polynomial. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would mean that perhaps the \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out. Wait, but how? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning the term where \\(c^0\\), because then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was correct earlier that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so that would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expression.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then multiply them. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the presence of the second term suggests that it's more involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, considering all terms from the second part. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or if it's only interested in the constant term, which would be 120. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a single number, which would mean that maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to think of it as a product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each of these terms, so the coefficient would be 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems too complicated for the problem. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting 384, considering the sum of all coefficients. But I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's a way to interpret the problem such that the coefficient is a single number. If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a single number, that suggests that perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Let me check that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a single number, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to verify with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficients are polynomials. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression, it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which one is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. However, since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a single number, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 384. But I'm not sure. I think I'll go with the interpretation that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, but if the problem is asking for a single number, then perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients, which is 384. Alternatively, if it's expecting the constant term, it's 120. Hmm, I'm still unsure. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. I think I need to make a decision. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the same, a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a single number, so that suggests that perhaps it's only interested in the constant term. Given that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But given that the problem is asking for a single number, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term.

Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial.

When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems to contradict the problem's request for a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients, which is 384. Given that, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not 6 times the entire expansion, but rather, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's correct because when you multiply a term by each term in another polynomial, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to consider the entire expansion of the second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm missing something because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the first expression only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms that are products of terms from each. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would multiply with each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps only the constant term in the second part would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but does the second part have a constant term? Let me check.\n\nThe second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would be the constant term, right? Because if the exponent is zero, \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, let's solve for \\(m\\) when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). So, \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with the constant term 20 from the second part, giving us \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20, so when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I were to multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, and then when multiplied by any term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which would be the constant term in the second part. So, that's why we only need to consider the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other terms. Suppose I have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\), right? Because otherwise, it would specify \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, yeah, I think I'm correct in only considering the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that any term involving \\(c\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is separate. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. \n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem. Let me write this expansion as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. When I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), which is just the constant term. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together to get 120. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Well, the expression is a product of two separate binomials, so the coefficients are independent except for the multiplication. So, I think the approach is correct. \n\nAnother check: if I consider the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term (c^0) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think I need to consider how the two parts multiply together. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think. Wait, no, actually, the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of these will contribute to the overall product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient of some term in the second expansion). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly accurate because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a monomial, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then note that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Let me think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). The sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when variables are involved, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the cross terms don't affect each other. So, I think my reasoning is correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expansion of both parts and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but actually, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But wait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms from the second part will not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when I multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part could have coefficients that are being multiplied by 6, but actually, no. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part's entire expansion is just a constant factor with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and wants its coefficient, considering that the other part is multiplied, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. That seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is more likely expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps assuming that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, but maybe the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6, and then consider that this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense unless the problem is expecting a specific term. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total sum is 64. So, 6*64=384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems too big, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the coefficient is 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see how the terms combine. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, that term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the approach would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}\\) would be \\(a^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k\\) would be \\(b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term I'm interested in, which is \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by something from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will give me a term in the product. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when I expand the entire expression, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate expansion and then, when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion from the other part. But wait, actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part doesn't affect it because we're looking for a specific term. Let me think.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the expanded form, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, the coefficient is a numerical factor, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the other expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that coefficient by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I feel like the problem might be asking for something else. Let me check.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 1. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense because then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, let's try that.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering all coefficients, but now I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make it 120. Let me confirm.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated before, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's possible that it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in reality, the coefficient is a numerical factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean considering all possible terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's possible that it's considering all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), then it would be 1 times 1 (from the constant term), so 1.\n\nIn the given problem, since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, when variables are not specified, they are asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too high, and I think the more likely intended answer is 120, considering the constant term. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, in many problems like this, when variables are not mentioned, they're often asking for the constant term, so perhaps 120 is the intended answer.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to compute it another way. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\n\nWe can expand each part separately:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\)\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nFrom the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFrom the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should check if there's another way to interpret it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me see. In the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(b\\). That means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, but the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or maybe, since the entire expression is a product, the \\(c\\) terms will multiply with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part. But wait, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. But since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just multiplied by the entire second part. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion? But that can't be right because the second part is a separate term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A_0 + A_1a + A_2a^2 + A_3a^3 + A_4a^4 + \\text{terms with } b \\) and similarly, the second part is \\(B_0 + B_1c + B_2c^2 + \\dots + B_6c^6 + \\text{lower terms}\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two independent polynomials. So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would just be multiplied by the entire second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't sound right because the second part is a separate term. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two polynomials together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term from the second part, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) and even negative powers like \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\), that would only occur if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, that makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nThe expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to make sure I found the right coefficient for \\(c^0\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(k = 0\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6}\\), which is 1\u00d7c^6. When \\(k = 1\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4}\\), which is 6c^4. When \\(k = 2\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2}\\), which is 15c^2. When \\(k = 3\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0}\\), which is 20\u00d71. Then, for \\(k = 4\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2}\\), which is 15c^{-2}. For \\(k = 5\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4}\\), which is 6c^{-4}, and for \\(k = 6\\), it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\), which is 1\u00d7c^{-6}. So, yes, the constant term is indeed 20, so that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2, power of \\(b\\) is 2, and the power of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if the power of \\(c\\) is anything else, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms combine. But I think the way I did it before is correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). Thus, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem involves the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is another binomial expression. I think I need to consider how these two parts multiply together. Let me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms from the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that's not right. Actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will produce terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is multiplied by another binomial expression. So, actually, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it's being multiplied by every term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{another something}\\), then when I multiply them together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I collect all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply, you get terms that have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would mean we're summing over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, you'd get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that means I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, to recap: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and that term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 120. That makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is found when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term is just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it just contributes a scalar multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this expression. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient. I think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But only the term where the second factor is \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, which is 120. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, perhaps I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't seem right because I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), not any other terms. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you would get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That way, when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), I'll just have \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me calculate again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part gives me 20 as the constant term, so 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the terms from the first expansion will be multiplied by the terms from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means I need to consider how the multiplication works. Specifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) from the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term, but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), I think only the constant term from the second expansion matters. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by this constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from the constant term). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and then we have to multiply it by something from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think I need to consider how it's multiplied by the other terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part. Wait, actually, no. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion will be multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant multiplier for each term in the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right either because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, it just says \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all the coefficients in that expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms has different powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, multiplying 6 by 64 gives 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to multiply the coefficients? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then consider how it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) just tag along? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). It just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply the two expressions, the exponents of \\(c\\) can cancel out. Let me see. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be a constant term. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, as I thought earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k=3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I think that's the answer they're looking for. But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to interpret the problem. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, without considering \\(c\\). That would mean treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to fit the question's phrasing. The question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient when considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, but no, because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would be a coefficient that includes \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that we need to consider. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to approach this differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384.

But that seems a bit off because the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's a separate variable. So, maybe the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the second part, so I think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me check that. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms, is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient where \\(c\\) terms cancel out, giving \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems more complicated, and I think the intended answer is 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, which suggests that we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable and sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you consider the term with all variables specified. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\), giving 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I consider the entire product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-m} = a^kb^{4 - k}\\), but that's not correct because the exponents from the second part would be \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I found earlier. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. But in reality, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes sense because then you're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nSo, to summarize, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is found by taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by actually expanding the terms. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if we consider that \\(c^0\\) is the only term where \\(c\\) doesn't affect the power, then 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and if \\(c\\) is another variable, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply the two expansions, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that can't be right because the exponents of \\(c\\) would vary, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because then we're considering the specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nTo recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) are present. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in that expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just be 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), when multiplied by terms from the other expansion, it will create terms that have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I misread. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion, but maybe the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which might not be intended. So, let me consider that possibility. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial expansion. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is to the 0 power. Since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), maybe it's the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\) to stay as \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes more sense, and I think that's what was intended. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just gets multiplied by the coefficient we found, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then that term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems confusing. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively just scaling it by the entire expansion. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply it by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which would change the term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will contribute to a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) component, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

    "text": " Let me think. In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write down the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) will just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate variable. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, and the second part just adds more terms without affecting the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem is presented as a single coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the term where \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, which has coefficient 20, so yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That should correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6. So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.

So, maybe I don't need to worry about the second part affecting \\(a^2b^2\\), unless there's some interaction. Wait, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is only affected by the first part, and the second part will just contribute a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply it by terms from the second expansion, which involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the result will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of specific terms add up if they result in the same term. But in this case, since the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because there's no way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. Wait, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Let me check that. So, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would only include terms where the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that you're left with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I need to find terms in the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply together to give \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the only term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Then, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer. But let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using binomial coefficients, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or is it considering all possible terms?

Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all the terms from both expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or something similar. So, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient is just the numerical factor in front of the term, regardless of other variables. Wait, no, actually, in the entire product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the entire first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you substitute \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated before, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where the product gives \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve only the terms from the first expansion, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficients add up. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, it's 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Let me consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " Let me figure out which term that is. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Let me write the entire expression again: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when you multiply terms from each expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will add up. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). That way, when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), I can solve for \\(m\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that calculation seems off. Let me check: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by identifying the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which gives us 20. Multiplying these coefficients together yields 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), yes. So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need to consider the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients from the two expansions will multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a coefficient that's a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nPerhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to consider how that can happen. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(c^0\\), that's just 1, so multiplying by that would give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense now. So, I need to find two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to find the constant term, which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and how terms combine. But I think the approach I took is solid. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and to get a term without \\(c\\), we need the constant term from the second part. So, multiplying them gives the correct coefficient.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives the final result: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product. Wait, but the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, I think that means I only need to consider the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expression, and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think that means I just need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) multiplied by any term in \\(Q\\) will just be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q\\). But since \\(Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\(P\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), each contributing to different terms in the product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term in \\(Q\\) equal to its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(Q(1)\\). \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\(P\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But the coefficient in the product would just be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. When I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each of the coefficients from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we're effectively summing all these contributions, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Which, as I found earlier, is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, maybe the only contribution comes from the term where the second part is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the constant term is 20, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that.

So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by something else? No, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion that isn't a constant term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, that's correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, yes, because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120, so that seems right.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
