Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each respective part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only looking at the term where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. So, that's why we only need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that's the sum of all coefficients, not the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, that approach might not be helpful.
