Using the binomial expansion, that term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That seems right. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this or if I might have missed something. Another approach could be to consider the entire product, but that might complicate things. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, it's safe to treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients. So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the exponents add up appropriately.

    "text": " The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first expression and we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expression that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it just scales the term by its constant term. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's recalculate the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when k=2, so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when m=3, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.
