Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. However, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product have \\(c\\) terms, which we're not interested in. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the term \\(20c^0\\) in the second part. So, when multiplied, it's \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when multiplied by 6, gives the overall coefficient. So, since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply two terms, one from each polynomial, the exponents just add. But since we're looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that can combine with terms in the second polynomial to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. There's no other combination because any term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.
