So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 for \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). So, yes, \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. The coefficients are 6 and 20, respectively, so multiplying them gives 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term could be formed. For example, could there be a term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by a term in the first polynomial, gives \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so any term in the product that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term.

I need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0\\) is what I want. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it as each term in the expansion being a product of a term from each binomial, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second binomial, so yes, it's 6 * 20 = 120.

We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\) is the constant term.

So, expanding, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\): yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the constant term, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - m - m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), it's 6, that's correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), it's 20, that's correct as well. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was realizing that when you multiply two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term we're looking for. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, since any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want.
