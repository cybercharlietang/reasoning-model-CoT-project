Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I notice that the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not in any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those will create a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will we get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me confirm that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so when multiplied together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the variables in the second part are different, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables together. But that would require multiplying the two expansions, which might involve cross terms. Wait, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, it's considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the rest can be any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be in the expansion of both variables together, but that seems unlikely. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the term where in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which would be the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Then, I can multiply that constant term by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). All other terms would have a power of \\(c\\), making them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which aren't considered when we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to consider that as well, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking for the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the constant term in the second expansion. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to expand this as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But wait, if I do that, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems contradictory because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. Wait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables and don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should expand both expressions and then find the coefficient. Let's see. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, in which case it would still be 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Wait, the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I should consider that the coefficient is 6, as the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I'm confused because the problem includes both expressions multiplied together, so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems like it would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms as separate, meaning that the coefficient is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum, not a single number. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables and don't influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that seems too simplistic, especially since the problem includes both expressions multiplied together. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might not be asking for that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (1 + 1)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 2, which is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But given that the problem includes both expressions multiplied together, I think it's more accurate to say that the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Because if I multiply by anything else, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\n1.

Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms with powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second expansion will just be constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's sufficient to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, actually, that might not be the case. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the term in the second expansion that's a constant, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would change the variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables don't matter. So, perhaps I only need to consider the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, that will give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Alternatively, if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would give me a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think I only need the constant term from the second expansion. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the first part's expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part's expansion gives a constant term 20, so when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6*20=120. So, yes, that should be the coefficient. Alternatively, if I were to multiply the entire expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6 * 20 * \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the other part of the expression is multiplied by this, I needed to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6*20=120. Yep, that's correct.

Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since the second expression is multiplied by the first, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term, right?

Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, let me check that. So, the first part gives me a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) varies. The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\), and the first only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially considering all possible products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the constant term is indeed 20. So, using the binomial coefficients:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\).\n- \\(k=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\).\n- \\(k=2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\).\n- \\(k=3\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n- \\(k=4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\).\n- \\(k=5\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\).\n- \\(k=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\).\n\nYes, so the constant term is indeed 20. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the second part that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? No, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I guess I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying it by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second expression would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Any other term in the second expression would result in a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is indeed 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6*20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product, but since the two parts are independent, the coefficients multiply. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think we might be looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the same as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part has terms involving \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) from the first part. Now, for the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in its expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so it doesn't affect the variables. So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought maybe the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but now I'm seeing that it's actually only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a \\(c\\) component, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) term with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if I had considered the entire second expansion, the sum of all coefficients would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), but that's not what we need here because we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms will multiply the terms from the first expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) in it, we need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\) because that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be obtained by taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by every term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product affects the coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Hmm, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials P(a,b) and Q(c), then the product P(a,b)*Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in Q(c). Wait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the variables are separate. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from Q(c), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from P(a,b) times the sum of all coefficients from Q(c). Because each term from Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from P(a,b) times the entire expansion of Q(c), because each term in Q(c) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from Q(c). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), then multiply them together. Let me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any condition on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from Q(c) multiplied by 6, which would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be any term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of Q(c), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense, as the coefficient would then be a single number. So, which is it? I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve multiple terms, which doesn't make sense. So, I'll proceed under that assumption. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have two expressions: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. If I multiply them together, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would actually be the coefficient of a^2b^2 times any power of c, which would be 0 because there's no a^2b^2 term in the product. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2, the expansion would have terms like a^2c^2, a^2*1, a^2*(1/c^2), etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^0 would be 1 times the entire expansion of (c + 1/c)^2, which is 1*(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2). But that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, which would be the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems unlikely because the problem mentions both a, b, and c, but asks only about a^2b^2. So, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of a^2b^2 times c^0, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of c, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients 6 * coefficient of c^k in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the answer if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't mention c at all, so it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a sum involving c, but perhaps not. Wait, no, the coefficient is just a number, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has a coefficient, and the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering the constant term. So, which is it? Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about c, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. To resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually phrased. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term that includes multiple variables, it's referring to the term where all those variables have the specified exponents, and other variables are not considered unless specified. So, in this case, since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2m\\). If we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. However, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's the sum over all m of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But since the problem specifically mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of c, it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's considering the term where those variables have the specified exponents and the other variables are at their lowest possible exponents, often zero. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 (from c^6 term), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) which would be 6 * 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. The confusion arises because the problem didn't specify the exponent of c, but when it says \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient across all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be the term where \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), which is \\(a*(1/c)\\) when c=1, but that's not directly applicable. Wait, no, in this case, the term \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be \\(a * 1/c\\) only if \\(c = 1\\), but that's not how it works. Actually, in the expansion, the term \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would require that the exponents of c cancel out, but in this case, it's not possible because each term has either c or 1/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is zero. Therefore, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is zero. So, depending on how the problem is phrased, the answer can be different. Therefore, going back to the original problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify c, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, applying that logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, I think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. Let me try to find another way to confirm. Suppose I set c = 1 in the entire expression. Then, the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, this confirms that if we set c = 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this as well, but wait, do I need to consider it for the term \\(a^2b^2\\)? Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would mean that any term from the second expression that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would just contribute a constant factor, right? Wait, no, actually, that's not correct either. Because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, I think we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's another expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only concerned about how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second part will just add more factors, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression. Let me clarify: the entire expression is the product of two independent expressions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat each part separately. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever the entire second part is, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply, you're distributing each term. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that's not exactly right either. Let me think carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I think I might have misunderstood the problem. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second part, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no. Let me clarify: When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. Let's compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(c\\) is raised to 0 power, which is the constant term. Wait, no, that's not right because the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think again. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me analyze again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because when you distribute, each term in the second part multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which would give \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But why would that be the case? The problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, the coefficient is a number, but in the context of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems counterintuitive because usually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose product gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial, and the total coefficient is the sum of those scalings. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me confirm this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)^2(c + 1)\\), the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and by \\(1\\), so the coefficient is \\(1 \\times c + 1 \\times 1 = c + 1\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of the coefficients when \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term. Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering the coefficient in the entire expression, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\). But as it stands, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. I think the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second part. That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of it differently. Suppose we consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384. But that seems too large. Wait, let me think of it in another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second part, and the total coefficient is the sum of those scalings. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1)\\), the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c + 1\\), giving \\(ac + a\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, it's not possible unless we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the intended answer is 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to see what the standard approach is. In problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, you're supposed to consider the term in the first expression and multiply it by the corresponding term in the second expression that doesn't affect the variables you're interested in. So, in this case, since we're interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second expression as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, giving 120. I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find similar problems online or in textbooks. Wait, I think the standard approach is that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, so the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. I think the intended answer is 120, considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the constant term (20) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait a minute, so how does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I think I need to consider how the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) interacts with the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but the variables here are different: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) vs. \\(c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term like \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the only way to get a term without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), so that \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't miss anything. So, the first part's expansion gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's expansion gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since these are multiplied together in the original expression, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, including both parts? Or is the second part independent? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the variables in the two parts are different (a, b vs. c, 1/c), the cross terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but since the variables are different, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (if any) from the second part. But the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider how the variables interact. Wait, actually, no. Because the variables in the two parts are different, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are in terms of c. So, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that's only if we're considering the entire product. But in reality, each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. However, since the second part doesn't involve a or b, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c and 1/c, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a factor of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k. So, actually, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), depending on the expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present only once, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when c = 1, which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The first expansion has terms with a and b, the second with c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, no, because the second expansion is a separate polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, because the variables are different, so the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is a polynomial in c, so when you multiply, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and since a, b, c are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Wait, no, because the second part doesn't have a constant term. Wait, no, the second part does have a constant term, which is 20, as I calculated earlier. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (20) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that is a constant (i.e., c^0). So, in the second expansion, the only term that is a constant is the term with c^0, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. So, my earlier thought that it was 384 was incorrect because I was considering all terms, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me verify this. So, the first expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when c^0, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we only need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term from the second part. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any other variables. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire second part evaluates to? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient in the product, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's in the product of these two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the expansion, and its coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial. But the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach because the problem might be expecting a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number, which contradicts the question's phrasing. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then realize that when multiplied by the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, the final answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that multiplies the entire term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's considering only the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we have to consider both parts. Let me think about that. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nBut the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it earlier. Let me check: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial. But that can't be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to confirm, let me break it down again:\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHence, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the coefficient if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), perhaps it's intended to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 384. But that seems inconsistent because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term with specific exponents for all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120, assuming that \\(c^0\\) is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is as written: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not worrying about \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think: in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), not about any specific term involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. I think I need to clarify this. \n\nLet me consider an example: suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + d)^1\\). If I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that's not possible because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. But in our case, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think this is more likely because it's a common type of problem where you're asked for a specific term in the product, considering all variables. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nHence, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. I think the correct approach is to consider the specific term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so that the term is just a constant. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the constant term in the second part (with respect to \\(c\\)) will give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The original problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. So, going back, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\)) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is raised to the 6th power, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire second part just contributes a multiplicative factor to the coefficient, regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). Let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the second part just contributes a scalar multiple. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms that have powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems incorrect because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would still mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that logic again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, for example, if P(a, b) = ... + 6a^2b^2 + ..., and Q(c) = ... + q_k c^k + ..., then the product would have terms like 6a^2b^2 q_k c^k + ..., so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be 6 times the sum of all q_k, which is 6 times Q(1). Since Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6, then Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the product includes terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, each term would be of the form (coefficient from a^2b^2 in first part) multiplied by (each term from the second part). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me explore that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure if that's what it's asking for. If it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make the coefficient a number, 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But that seems more likely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're to consider the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. Let me try to clarify. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression, which has powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a number, 384, which seems plausible. Let me think again: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I have P(a, b) * Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) is multiplied by Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * Q(c). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would require considering the coefficient as a polynomial, which isn't what the problem is asking. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to compute both possibilities. First, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's 6 * 20 = 120. If I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's 6 * 64 = 384. Now, which one is more likely? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a number, 384, which is the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me see if I can find similar problems online or in textbooks. Wait, I'm trying to remember if there's a standard approach to this. When you have a product of two polynomials, and you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the variables from the second polynomial, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That means, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if there's a constant term, then that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will keep it as \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's no constant term, then the coefficient would be zero. So, let me check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me compute that again: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part contributes a factor of 20, which is a scalar, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

So, does that mean the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part that gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by that doesn't change anything. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the multiplication affects the terms. Wait, but the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, the variables are independent. That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. So, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then any term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, simplifying that, it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by the respective binomial coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the variables are separate. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient. So, since the second part is independent, the coefficient would just be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times\\) the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach: think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But that can't be right because then it would depend on \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second binomial expansion. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the combined term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(k = 0\\), so we're looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

That seems a bit confusing because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, or is the problem just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part? Wait, no, the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by some terms from the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps only the constant term from the second part will contribute.

The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the product as a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is structured such that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve the product of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way it can be multiplied by a term in the second expression is if the second term is also \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, but that would give a different result. Wait, let me think about that. If I consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think my initial approach was correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect this coefficient? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first part is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think that means the coefficient when considering all variables, but perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve terms from both parts. Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expression. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the problem asks for \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you might need to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is acceptable. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is possible. However, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\), so perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible terms, but that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all terms from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an unusual interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expansion, so it's a polynomial, not a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains as 6. But that seems too simplistic. Let me think about it differently. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiplying by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term of the coefficient, meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make the coefficient a number. Let me check that possibility. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and also considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more likely, as it results in a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but if it's asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, as each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the constant term, which would be 120, as calculated earlier. But the problem didn't specify, so I'm not sure. However, given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if expanded, it's a polynomial, but perhaps the problem is expecting the expression in terms of \\(c\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, maybe I should check this again. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression includes the second part, which affects the coefficient. So, I think the correct answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, not as a polynomial. So, maybe I need to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find its constant term, then multiply by 6 to get the constant term of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the constant term of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the constant term, which is 120. That seems more likely, as it's a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut given that the problem is presented as is, without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the most straightforward answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check this with an example. Let me take a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), since \\((a + b)^2\\) has a coefficient of 2 for \\(ab\\), but in that case, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so maybe that's a bad example.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the product will have terms that are combinations of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. As calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. However, given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but in this problem, it's non-zero. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAfter considering all this, I think the correct answer is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering the constant term. Hmm, perhaps I should confirm once more.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the final answer is as above.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I made a mistake in considering the entire second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the final answer is as I wrote before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I'll box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure because in the initial expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it becomes a polynomial. However, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps I should reconsider.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this product is zero because there's no \\(ab\\) term. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be zero unless there's a cross term, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I do, because the entire expression is a product of two parts. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just being multiplied as a whole. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second part is? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that's just a constant, but actually, the second part might have terms that could affect the coefficient if there were more variables involved, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when considering the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms where each term's coefficient is a binomial coefficient. But no, actually, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're multiplying this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first product will be multiplied by each term in the second product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part will contribute its coefficient to the product. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and not considering the second part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so every term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that approach. Another way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6 a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, their coefficients are independent of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this part contributes to the overall expression. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect that term? Hmm, let me think. When we multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2 each, but the term will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Let me assume that's the case. So, the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. That makes more sense.\n\nAlright, so let's approach it that way. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) will remain 0. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient of that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but I assumed it meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Maybe I should confirm. If the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, which is usually a number. So, I think my assumption that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a numerical value. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, if I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I found earlier. So, that confirms it. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and the second part is a separate variable, maybe it's just 6 times the entire second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because they're separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in multiple terms in the product, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Hmm, actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the part of the expression that contributes to that term. So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6\\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but variables are multiplied as well. So, if I have 6\\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't change the power of \\(c\\), meaning the term that's just a constant. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. When you multiply these together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems to check out. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that means we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the exponents of \\(c\\) will cancel out to 0, so that the entire term is just a constant. Wait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in other words, when we expand the entire expression, what's the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any possible power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, which involve \\(c\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, so maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and any exponents of \\(c\\) are allowed. But that would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second part has a different coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all the products where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes any term. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient when considering only \\(a^2b^2\\) and not any specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients. But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 = 2k, so k = 3. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But now I'm confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, the answer could be 120 or 384. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 384 seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply, but the variables multiply as well. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that this term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that is just 1, right? Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the only term in the second expansion that would multiply without introducing any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the exponent to be zero (i.e., the term to be a constant), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that another term from the second expansion could combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to still give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? But no, because any term from the second expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), so unless it's the constant term, it would introduce \\(c\\) into the term, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, my calculation should be correct. The coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I calculated. Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the product of \\(6a^2b^2\\) with the constant term 20 that will give me \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply by that term, it won't change the exponent of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so \\(c^0\\) is 1, and multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is what I need. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, that's also correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120, which seems right.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I need to consider how the second part contributes. Wait, but the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the exponents of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion and multiply them by the corresponding terms in the first expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part, but that's not right either because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the variables match. In this case, the first polynomial has variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables don't overlap, meaning that when you multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the variables are different, the exponents don't combine. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but no, because the second part is not being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the second part is a separate term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) would result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me compute it correctly. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) must be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so does that mean that when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, all the terms in the second part are just constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the terms in the second expansion have different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply, the entire expression will have terms that are products of terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and terms in \\(c\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can be multiplied by any term from the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c\\) raised to some power. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient, so the sum is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\). Therefore, when we multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Alternatively, if I didn't think about it that way, I could have considered that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, specifically from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute a coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I expand both parts separately and then multiply, I can see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient part from the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms is just 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these individual coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't use that approach, I could have considered that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, as we found earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), and the first involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 * \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, that's the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second part becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which matches our earlier result. So, that's another way to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, so that gives me the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering generating functions or something else? Hmm, but I think the approach I've taken is solid. The key insight is recognizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the second part just scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by its coefficient.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me compute the product step by step. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the second expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. When we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, we get:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in this context, does that mean we're supposed to sum all the coefficients of terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) with any power of \\(c\\)? Because if so, then the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 + 36 is 42, plus 90 is 132, plus 120 is 252, plus 90 is 342, plus 36 is 378, plus 6 is 384. So, that's 384. So, that matches our earlier result.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I thought that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I had thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because that's the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it, that would be incorrect because the second part contributes a scaling factor to each term. So, each term in the second expansion scales the corresponding term in the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just 6, but 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, and then summed up, which gives 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and each term in the second part is a coefficient that scales \\(a^2b^2\\) by that coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum over all terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is indeed the correct interpretation. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or do we need to specify a particular power of \\(c\\) as well? The problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the answer would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\), it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, yes, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and double-checking, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has coefficients that sum to \\(64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. Wait, is that right? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will get multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) will just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, maybe I need to consider whether the \\(c\\) terms can affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second part has different exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, let me compute that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is a sum of different terms, each with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not quite accurate because each term in the second part has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from second part}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then each term in the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m=0 to 6). But the sum of binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if I'm missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But actually, no, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Let me check that. If \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), then \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's unclear whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm a bit confused because when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m} \\times \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\), it would be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's likely that the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, but that would be 6 * 1 (if the constant term is 1), but I don't think that's the case. Wait, let me check the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, then the answer would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6 * sum of all coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused because the problem might be expecting only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might be expecting just the coefficient from the first part, but I don't think so. The expression is a product of two binomials, so when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). That means that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.

Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the middle term, which is \\(c^0\\), so that's 1. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when you expand \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when you choose 3 \\(c\\) terms and 3 \\(1/c\\) terms, so the binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem might be expecting a single coefficient, not a sum over multiple terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the exponent on \\(c\\) doesn't matter. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would give me the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second is degree 1 in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe this isn't the best example. Let me try another one. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 times (c + 1/c). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient, perhaps I'm supposed to consider it as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we know is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. That makes sense because if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the only term that contributes is when the second part is a constant, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are typically numerical values, not polynomials.\n\nSo, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different calculation, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at its constant term, i.e., \\(k = 0\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, is the only thing that matters. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will not interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part will contribute a factor that is the sum of all terms in its expansion. But that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the first expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would actually be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing a \\(c\\) term. Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first binomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second binomial expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we're considering all possible terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and we're summing their coefficients across all the terms in the second expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that because sometimes when dealing with negative exponents or variables, the sum of coefficients might not be as straightforward. But in this case, since we're substituting \\(c = 1\\), it's valid because \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, multiplying by 6 gives 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).

Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check: It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is separate, the overall coefficient would still be 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression. Let me try another approach. Let me expand \\((a + b)^4\\) first and then consider the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check my reasoning again. The key point is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Let me try to think differently.

Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. I think that's the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, when we multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you're combining terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times something. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), but that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient in a product like this, you might be considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term from the second expansion. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables together. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat the entire second part as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in the second part. That would make the coefficient just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. If I consider only the constant term in the second part, then the entire coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify this. Alternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all terms from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part and the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part? Wait, no, that's not quite right either because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would come only from the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), that's a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), but in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. But in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part and \\(m = 3\\) in the second part, because that's when the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), we would have to consider other terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, hence the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that can't be right because the second part is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion of the product would be the sum over all possible products of terms from each expression. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms in the second part, because each term in the first part (specifically, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let's see. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me see. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct because each term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when summed over all its terms (by setting \\(c = 1\\)), equals 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Wait, that can't be right because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't appear unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's the case. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together. Let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or do I need to consider it in some way? Hmm, maybe I need to find the entire expansion and then pick out the specific term. Wait, no, the problem is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient from the second part is just a constant multiplier for that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at a certain term? Wait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the \\(c\\) terms, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the entire expression is a product, and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would still include terms with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I don't think so because the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because that would be a huge expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the answer would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. That seems plausible. So, let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial assumption was correct, that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the entire product. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire polynomial. But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so I think I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that's probably the intended answer.\n\nLet me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product and see if there's another way to approach it. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to consider the entire product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a combination of terms from the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a single number as the coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a \\dfrac{1}{c} + b c + b \\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be 1 (the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 1). So, that makes sense. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Hmm, but the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second polynomial are constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite correct either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a constant (since they involve only \\(c\\)), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a constant factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the total coefficient is the sum of all those scalings, which is 6 times 64. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it as the product of two polynomials. Let me denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in } Q(c)\\text{)}\\). However, since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but wait, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with different coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me think about the expansion. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of the terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the total coefficient is the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is effectively 0, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps that approach isn't correct. Instead, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not helpful. Let me think of another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1) = ac + a + bc + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a\\)), so total 2. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 (from \\(bc\\)) plus 1 (from \\(b\\)), so total 2, which is again the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, I set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, multiplying by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand the second part and see what the coefficients are. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's not possible because all terms will involve some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because otherwise, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times 64, which is 384. But perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be a specific term in the product. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in the context of such problems, usually, they mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if they just wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 384, but that seems too straightforward, and perhaps the problem is more about multinomial coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, how would that work?\n\nLet me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0. Let me compute that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem initially. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without any mention of \\(c\\). However, in the context of the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is part of the term, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 384, as I calculated earlier. However, in most problems like this, they specify the term they're interested in, including all variables, so perhaps it's more likely that they're asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But given that the expression includes \\(c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm a bit confused. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It says \"in\" the product, so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of it, regardless of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384, as each term in the second expansion scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by its coefficient. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is in the second factor, the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. Let me consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\). But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and since the product includes \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because both interpretations seem possible. Let me try to find a definitive way to solve this. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product is structured. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) exists when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 0\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is therefore the product of the coefficients from each part: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, but given that the expression includes \\(c\\), it's more reasonable to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but that seems incorrect because the product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it as a multinomial expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit uncertain because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Let me check online for similar problems to see how they are phrased. Hmm, I can't actually look things up, but based on standard problem structures, when they ask for the coefficient of a term in a product involving multiple variables, they usually specify all the variables involved. So, if they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might be referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me try to calculate it both ways to make sure. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous, but more likely, they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of \\(c\\), which seems odd because each term in the product includes a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). However, given the structure of the problem, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I need to think about it differently. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect that coefficient. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, the product terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, perhaps the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because \\(c\\) times \\(1/c\\) would be 1. Wait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) would be the middle term, right? Because in the expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of -2. So, the term where the exponent is 0 would be when the number of \\(c\\)s and \\(1/c\\)s are equal. So, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get the exponent 0, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nWait, so putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, indeed, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, is that all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, it's just scaling the coefficient by the constant term. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I should consider if there's any cross terms or something else that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the second part only contributes to terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to check the constant term. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me also think about the variables. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, it just scales the coefficient. So, the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed. For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by a term in the first expansion, gives \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if this part also needs to be expanded, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms from the second expansion will just contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient from the first part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, that would be the term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that should be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, I'm looking for the product of terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, since any term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two terms, each involving different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two parts, each involving different variables. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term in the second polynomial when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term involving \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because for each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Wait, no, that's not right because the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean I'm effectively summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is equivalent to evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), giving the sum of its coefficients. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), we don't have any restriction on the exponent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that's the same as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384? That seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are also part of the expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, that's a different approach. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the term where \\(c^0\\), which is when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. That occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which would be when we choose \\(m = 3\\) in the expansion, because then we have \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 3} \\times c^{-3} = c^{0}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when they say \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might be considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). In that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if there's a term in the expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that every term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, contributes to the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified that \\(c\\) should be zero or some other exponent, it would be different, but as it stands, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in effect, the coefficient would be 6 times the second polynomial, which is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\), then perhaps it's only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m \\), which simplifies to \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in this term is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6*64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient in that case would be 6*\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it would be 1, because that's the coefficient when \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps in this problem, the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe it's 384.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials with multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), unless specified otherwise. So, in that case, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But given the problem statement, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 384. Therefore, I'll go with 384 as the answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). So, expanding, we get \\(a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 4, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 4 (the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, applying this to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"
