    "text": " Wait, just another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term would be \\(120a^2b^2\\), right? So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
