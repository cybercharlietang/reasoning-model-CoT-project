    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would correspond to the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. In the binomial expansion, the exponent of a is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of b is k. So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. However, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves c and 1/c, and the first part is in terms of a and b, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, they don't interfere with each other. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, no, that can't be because the second part is an expansion, so actually, I think I need to consider that the second part will contribute a factor that might be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve a or b, maybe the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions: one in terms of a and b, and the other in terms of c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the terms in the first expansion only involve a and b, and the terms in the second expansion only involve c and 1/c, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each of which is a power of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering c. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating it as a product, but since the other part involves c and 1/c, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes the second part, so maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part is just a constant factor for that term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a polynomial in c, so how can that be? Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first expansion, so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving c. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be constants. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not an expression involving c.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is to consider the entire expression as a product, and when you expand it, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at c=1 gives the sum of coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of c cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as we found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part contributes a constant term, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me verify this step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the second expansion contributes a constant term, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that should give me the term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), and indeed, \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression, but only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we can treat the two parts separately, because the \\(c\\) terms are independent variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Wait, that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify: The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion (\\(a + b)^4\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion (\\(c + 1/c)^6\\)). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, which gives us the term with coefficient 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this term by each term from the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just one term in the first expansion, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\). Let's check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical value. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not the case because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion with \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but if we consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but perhaps only the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, making it a constant term. So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which seems high, but perhaps that's correct.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in the absence of any information about \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the total coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the first part and ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient accumulates all the contributions from the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought maybe it's 120, considering only the constant term in the second polynomial. But that would be the case if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which the problem isn't asking for. The problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a number. But if I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's (c + 1/c). Similarly, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), it would be 1 * (c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the first part, or that I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * (c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making the exponent zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe that's the intended interpretation. Let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the exponent to be zero, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, as I thought earlier, because it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. But given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), I think the intended answer is 384, because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) is unaffected by Q(c) because they are in different variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b), which is 6, multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, the coefficient is 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps the problem is only considering the first part, or that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables as separate, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * Q(c), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the answer is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But in reality, each term in the product is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the only term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which gives us \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's a term in the product, not a coefficient. Wait, no, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term is \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that's not correct because each term in the product has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not a standard way to interpret coefficients. Typically, the coefficient of a term in multiple variables is the coefficient when all the variables are considered together. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, as I calculated earlier, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which corresponds to \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(n\\) here is 4, so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But wait, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which also expands into terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient might be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all the terms from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical coefficient. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which would mean that we have to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) interacts with all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in that expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient is supposed to be a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in that case, the problem should specify that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me try to clarify.\n\nSo, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the overall expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, which should affect the coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible terms from both parts. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply it out, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) to form terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant for this term. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible combinations with \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a single coefficient. I'm confused now. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would mean that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like an unusual way to phrase the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we have to consider the product of the two expansions.

Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms, which again is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number.

But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which means that in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, if we consider only the constant term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify that it's looking for the constant term, so I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant.

Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at similar problems. For example, if you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of that term in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, so when multiplied by the second expression, each term in the second expression will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the entire expansion of the second expression multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed with the assumption that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of that term from each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, so the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient from the first expression times the entire expansion of the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant.

But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems too involved, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but only considering the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, as I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify that it's looking for the constant term, so I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant.

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(n = 4\\), and I need the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the exponent \\(k\\) in the binomial term corresponds to the power of \\(b\\). So, if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, so that's the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product will have terms involving both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for a coefficient in such a product, they might be considering only the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but in this case, it's multiplied by another expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're actually distributing it across all terms. Wait, but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that the right approach? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. That seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then note that it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me try that approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. That sounds more reasonable. So, let's do that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, the more reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's interesting because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all? So, when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term (if any) in the second expansion, right? Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because only then will the multiplication result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a constant term 20, so when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. The constant term in the second part is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's it. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me just recap to make sure. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. Find the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Multiply the coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever is multiplied by the term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. The variables are different, so when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because only that term won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. If we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which is not what we want. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's figure that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer then. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only term that won't involve \\(c\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), again using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nWait, let me check that again because sometimes I make mistakes with factorials. Alternatively, I know that \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is a common combination. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should write it out more formally. Let me denote the first expansion as \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and the second expansion as \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the product is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each of these terms, we also have a \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can be present in the product is if the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. For instance, sometimes in these problems, you can consider generating functions or other methods, but in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the method I used is the correct one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire expansion and check, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can think about how the terms combine. But I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2.

So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because the problem is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the multiplication will involve terms from both expansions. However, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Because the second expansion is entirely separate. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(6a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term will become \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) itself is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving a constant, which when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\) will give a term that is just \\(6 \\times \\text{constant} \\times a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, thus leaving the \\(a^2b^2\\) term as is. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term. Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6*20=120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, so I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), do I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which has a coefficient of 6) by the constant term (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. First, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\): the term \\(a^2b^2\\) indeed comes from \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I found the constant term by setting the exponent to 0, which gave \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Hmm, so I think that's right. Wait, but let me think again: when I multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second expression would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have a \\(c\\) component, thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that might be too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think about the degrees of the variables. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a total degree of 4. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term has degree 0. So, when I multiply them, the total degree is 4 + 0 = 4, which is consistent with \\(a^2b^2\\) being a degree 4 term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I had a term with \\(c\\) in it, the degree would be higher, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the constant term in the second expression. So, yeah, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make absolutely sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. Yep, that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have two separate binomial expansions multiplied together, the coefficients for specific terms multiply if the terms don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for their respective terms. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire expression, terms can have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's exactly what I did, so I think that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about this. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6, and second, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64. Let me calculate that: 6 * 64. Well, 6 * 60 is 360, and 6 * 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. So, the coefficient should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the two coefficients, as each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nJust to double-check, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is degree 4 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because that would require \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, but \\(n = 2\\), so \\(k\\) can only be 0, 1, 2. So, the term \\(a^{2 - 2}b^2 = a^0b^2 = b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Hmm, but in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that's why it's non-zero.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the exponents for \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I were to consider specific terms, say, \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^4\\), etc., each of those terms would have coefficients, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first. So, yes, that's why it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient from the second polynomial for \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nJust to confirm, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that part checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. Therefore, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to the term where \\(k = 2\\). Because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of b is 2, and the exponent of a is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of c, I think the coefficient will just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Wait a second, that's not right. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it will have multiple terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in the second part. Wait, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when multiplied together can give a constant term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, that would mean that we're looking for all the terms in the second expansion, multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of c, each with their own coefficients. But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1, which would make \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we need a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two expressions, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. So, when we multiply them, the terms in a and b are separate from the terms in c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, if the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by plugging c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat the entire expression as a single expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating it as a single expression. But since the two variables are separate, a and b, and c is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the second part is raised to the 6th power, and when multiplied by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in the second part, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, let me check that. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of c is zero would be the middle term, which is when the number of c's equals the number of 1/c's. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of c is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where k = 3 is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me verify this. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 * 6 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that was incorrect. Instead, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. I think I'm confusing something here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression also involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it would give a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That means, in the expanded form of the product, what is the coefficient attached to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are independent variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the product will have specific exponents for \\(a, b, c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not accurate because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would just carry that coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, and then sum them all up, you get 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which effectively means multiplying the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply. But in this case, since \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the expansion of the second part includes multiple terms with different coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of those coefficients, summed together. But that's equivalent to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. I think I can be confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, actually, no. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\), that means when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains as 6, and the entire second part is just a constant factor? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's not a constant. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're considering all the terms, but in reality, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I need to interpret the problem differently. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the second part. But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the second part is multiplied. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not quite right either because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expression, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so if we consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other part? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), that means we only need the term from the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion that has \\(1\\) (since \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that would be the constant term, which is 1. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I took a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^k\\) and multiplied it by a term from the first expansion, that would introduce a \\(c^k\\) factor. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the only way that can happen is if we multiply by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I don't think there are any other terms contributing to this. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. Let me recheck the calculations. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4 choose 2 is 6. \n\nSecond, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. \n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the right answer.

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part interacts with the first part when we multiply them together. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) and \\(a^kb^m c^{-n}\\), etc. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect that term, I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^n\\) or \\(c^{-n}\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-n}\\), which are different terms, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part. \n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, the coefficient is indeed 20 \u00d7 6 = 120. \n\nIs there any chance I missed something? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when multiplying the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I considered the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, and there's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): \n\n- The terms are \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion will have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) decrease by 2 each time, starting from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The middle term is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), as we found. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, when we multiply the two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(4a^4c^4\\), \\(6a^4c^2\\), \\(4a^4\\), \\(6a^4c^{-2}\\), etc. Similarly, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that can only come from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we needed to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables are independent. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables don't interfere. So, that's another confirmation that 120 is correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). In the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that. When \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I only need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire second part, but wait, no. Actually, no, because the second part is a separate variable. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Hmm, no, actually, that might not be the case because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems odd because the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. Hmm, I think I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor, but only if the variables match in a way that their exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the entire second expansion. But that seems confusing because the second expansion isn't a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about it again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each coefficient in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6, and all those are added together to get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second polynomial is being multiplied entirely, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a scalar; it's a sum of terms. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. Let's consider a simpler example to see if this approach works. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(c + 1/c = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's verify by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this product, there's no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). The terms are either \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), or \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient would be 0, not 2. So, my earlier approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, but according to my previous reasoning, it would be 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part) equals 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nSo, I need to rethink this. Maybe I misunderstood how the coefficients interact when variables are separate. Let me think again. So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent variables, so when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient, but there is no term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), except when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), there is a constant term? Let me check. When you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For there to be a constant term, the exponent must be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20, and the other terms have exponents of \\(c\\) either positive or negative.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier simple example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term in the second polynomial is when \\(k = 0.5\\), but that's not an integer, so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that case would be 0, which matches the actual expansion. So, in the original problem, since the second polynomial has a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me verify this. Let me take the original problem: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as we found. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. All other terms in the second polynomial will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384, but that was incorrect because in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, the correct approach is to realize that only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because all other terms involve \\(c\\) and thus don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check this by expanding the second polynomial to find the constant term. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire product again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from the second polynomial}\\). Therefore, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the term from the second polynomial is a constant, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've got it now. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \n   The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). We are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).\n\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^{2}b^{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \n   The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0:\n\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   \n   The constant term is then:\n\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part.\n\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(n - k = 2\\) when \\(k = 2\\) (since \\(n = 4\\)). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on a second. The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the variables are different. That is, the first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. \n\nSo, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms from each are multiplied together. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by 6, you'll get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expression, which isn't a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient might actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem to be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the numerical factor in front. Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any factors from the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term in \\(c\\). Wait, that might be the case. So, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient would be a number, and the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant.\n\nSo, let me proceed with that understanding. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the expansion again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, yes, that's 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so the exponents add up to 4, which makes sense since the expansion is of the 4th power. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents are 2 and 2, so \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that coefficient will just be multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging in \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this again because I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as two separate binomial expansions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is it correct to just multiply the coefficients? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in one polynomial, and any term from the other polynomial will be in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself doesn't exist unless multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Wait, that's a good point. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then will the \\(a^2b^2\\) term not be multiplied by any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), thus resulting in a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me correct that. First, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because earlier I thought it was 384, but that was incorrect because I didn't consider that only the constant term in the second polynomial would result in a term without \\(c\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me verify this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial expansion, that term is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term. So, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, yielding 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would mean that in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) equals \\(a^2b^2\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, I need to compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate binomial expressions multiplied together, I can think of the expansion as the product of two sums. That is, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I realize that the coefficient won't be affected by the second part. Wait, is that right? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to 0, I might need to consider the terms in the second expansion that result in \\(c^0\\). Because only those terms will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait a minute, so maybe I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression isn't just 6 times something, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only those terms won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. \n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again to this expression. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and this is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). When I multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is obtained by multiplying the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms is if it contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives me a constant term with a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together, I get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can consider a different approach. Let's think about the entire expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first expansion, it's multiplied by each term \\(c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) from the second expansion, which simplifies to \\(c^{2m - 6}\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, which as we saw before comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2\\). For this term, when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2m - 6}\\). Since I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) from the first part times \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) from the second part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. Yep, that's consistent with what I found earlier. \n\nI think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, does that mean that the coefficient remains 6, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected? Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify. When we multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will have their own coefficients. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's not just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. Instead, it's the coefficient from the first part times each coefficient from the second part, but only for the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the resulting term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in all those products. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of the coefficients in the second expansion, but only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify whether it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or not. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in algebra usually means the coefficient when you multiply out the entire expression, considering all variables. So, in that case, each term in the expansion would have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Let's think about it differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, let me confirm this. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in that case, it's correct. So, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify whether they want the coefficient considering all variables or just specific ones. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But I think I need to clarify that. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically would include all possible exponents of other variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384. But I'm still a bit confused because sometimes in problems, if you're asked for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, it might imply that those other variables are set to a certain value or that you're considering the term independent of them. But in this case, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is found by multiplying the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). The first polynomial contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second polynomial contributes 1 (the multiplicative identity) because it's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is simply 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. To double-check, let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, it's clear that the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect that term? Let me think. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect it. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply every term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are separate variables, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, such as \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part? Wait, no, that can't be. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which should be a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts are considered as part of the overall term. But that seems odd because usually, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient would include all the variables. Wait, but in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^ib^jc^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering the product as a whole, and \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but without any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the expression includes \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), but not specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem expects a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nLet me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, let's compute that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, that would be incorrect because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me solve for \\(k\\): \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of these two parts. But wait, the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does the second part affect this coefficient? Hmm, actually, yes, because when you multiply the two expanded expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to make sure that when we multiply terms from the second expansion, they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, the terms from the second part should only contribute constants, not involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Let me think about that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Each term in this expansion is a power of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms multiply as well. However, in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that might complicate things because \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so technically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables \\(c\\) can be anything. But then, the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, I need to clarify this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. However, the question is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a single number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, and treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but perhaps we're supposed to collect like terms. Wait, but in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. That makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me calculate that. First, as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first coefficient is 6, the second coefficient is 20, and when you multiply them, you get 120. That seems correct. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomial expansions. Since the two binomials are in different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, let's compute that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the number of combinations of \\(n\\) things taken \\(k\\) at a time. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Now, I'm a bit confused because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents shouldn't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's actually just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is raised to the 6th power, which would result in a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes only from the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But actually, no, the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they're separate variables. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually appear multiple times in the product, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me think differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the second part is part of the same expression. Let me try to clarify. Suppose I have two separate polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, the resulting polynomial will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. The key point is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which for \\(n = 4\\), that happens when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent, right? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the product as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for a specific term in the product, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, the variables are separate, so the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms don't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (if any) from the second part. But wait, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because all the terms have either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we take a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. But does that expansion have a constant term? Let me check. Using the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by 20, and the term from the second expansion without \\(c\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we only consider the term from the second expansion that is a constant, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get that term is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients add up for each term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's just a single term multiplied by all the terms in the second expression. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would be the same as in the first part, because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), then when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\). So, in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\), because the \\(Q(c)\\) part is separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, as the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power, and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that might make sense. Let me think: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Yes, that makes sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(k \\times c^n\\), where \\(k\\) is a coefficient and \\(n\\) is an integer. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{n} k_n c^n\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{n} k_n\\), where \\(k_n\\) are the coefficients from \\(Q\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another way. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then see how the terms combine. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I found earlier. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (64)\\) when considering the sum of coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the sum of the coefficients in this expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm just multiplying it by some expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Wait, actually, no. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion, because any other term would involve \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), looking for the constant term, which is when exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's see, for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the part of the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are present, and I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider each term's contribution. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. Because otherwise, if I'm just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just a constant. So, that makes more sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me approach this step by step. First, I'll expand each part separately and then find the product. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product and look for the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me try that.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is as I did before: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the product will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so as before, \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the \\(c\\) terms, I need \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) to be \\(c^0\\), because I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term we're interested in is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), multiplied by \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the product of the two expansions will have terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, is there any other term that could contribute? For example, could there be other \\(m\\) values where \\(6 - 2m\\) is zero? Well, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) only when \\(m = 3\\), so that's the only term contributing to \\(c^0\\). Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion. Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me also think about it another way. If I consider the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, I think it's more likely that they're asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a coefficient that's a function of \\(c\\), not a single number. So, that doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me also check by expanding both parts and looking for the term. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has the term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In other words, the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a scalar multiple, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part's expansion evaluated at the relevant term. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, actually, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not just numbers; they are terms with \\(c\\) involved. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression with \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical answer. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve multiplying the binomial coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but how? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, I have \\((a + b)^4\\), and I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, I have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered all coefficients, but that approach was wrong because it didn't take into account the specific power of \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2.

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, that would occur when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I can ignore the second part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do I need to consider how the second part affects it? Let me think. When multiplying two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then maybe the terms from the second part don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be quite right. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that might not be accurate either. Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, in the product of two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the part of the product where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part just adds more terms with \\(c\\)? Or is it that the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression? Hmm, no, that might not be right. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nSuppose I have two expressions: \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be a sum of terms, each being the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those products. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get multiple terms in the product, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, that makes sense because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nSo, let me calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, 6 * 64 is 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because every term in the second polynomial will contribute when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that approach also leads to 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me just confirm with another method. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as established. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's 64, as before. Therefore, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is contributing its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(Q(1) = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. I can't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression I'm dealing with is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have two separate parts here: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). Since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, every term in the first is multiplied by every term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nActually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that polynomial, each term will contribute to a different part of the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that the case? Or is it that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that in the final product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get the sum of all the coefficients. Let me compute that. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we have \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64. Let me calculate that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check this because I'm not sure if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) include all the possible terms with different powers of \\(c\\), or is it just the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term? Hmm, I think it's the former. That is, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present in the product unless multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. So, maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nLet me clarify: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (for each k) will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so unless there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only the constant term would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me see where I went wrong. Initially, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which gave me 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. But now I realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if there's a \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. If I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) because every term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's looking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on how I interpret the question. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we consider that in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the way the problem is phrased is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term that can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because for each term in the second polynomial, you're adding a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\). In this product, the terms involving \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). The coefficients are 1 and 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, using the method I thought of earlier: the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Therefore, in this smaller example, the method works. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2/c\\) is 1. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second). So, that seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut now I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought that maybe the problem wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120. But given that in the smaller example, the method of multiplying by the sum of coefficients gives the correct result, I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is. However, that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute a part of it. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified that it wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product, it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second). So, in that case, it's the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, it should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, after this lengthy thought process, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is. Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the sum is 64, and 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing myself because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which is 1 * 2. So, similarly, in the original problem, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, but I think that's not what's being asked here.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n3. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, that would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and see how they multiply together. But actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since they are different variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables \\(a, b\\) are different from \\(c\\), the product of any term from the first expansion with any term from the second expansion will result in a term that has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term will be multiplied by various terms from the second expansion, each of which has powers of \\(c\\). However, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms, which isn't the case. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expression. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involving \\(c\\) is separate. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for specific terms in one variable part are independent of the other variable parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not considering the other variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms, but actually, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me compute that. First, as we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would indeed be 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for that specific term. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient where both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the 0 power. So, in that case, I need to compute the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's considering only the term where \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But I think in the context of the problem, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they're referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I can check by considering the entire expansion. Let me write out the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Let me compute that sum: 1 + 6 is 7, plus 15 is 22, plus 20 is 42, plus 15 is 57, plus 6 is 63, plus 1 is 64. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that's if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so the coefficient is 120. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in the context of the product, each term in the product will have the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs we calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me confirm by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. That makes sense because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2. \n\nApplying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, it's ambiguous. But in the context of the problem, since the expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps the answer is 120. \n\nWait, but in the earlier example with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which includes both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), and asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be 2, considering both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Similarly, in our problem, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they are referring to all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because in the product, each term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as in the first polynomial, because when you multiply by the second polynomial, you're essentially scaling each term by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as we found earlier. \n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically when \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Since the problem doesn't specify, but just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the problem is presented. It's a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. \n\nApplying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm going to double-check my calculations. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as we found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm going to think about this differently. Let's consider the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense.

That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, in the expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, setting \\(4 - k = 2\\), which gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need to consider the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part, because any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce variables that aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will result in a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that calculation seems a bit off. Let me check that again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so it's 720 divided by (6 * 6) which is 36, so 720 / 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is it that straightforward? Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or perhaps it's just considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, but I think I might have misread the problem. Wait, let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating all variables together. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if the second factor contributes a \\(c^m\\) term, then the entire term would have \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), but we want the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\).

Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other part involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient will actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, but perhaps they just want the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each step. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yes, that seems right. Alternatively, if the problem had been to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the answer would involve that \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is \\(c^0\\). So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, okay, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, in the product, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, actually, when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Is that right? Let me think. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and, say, \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) from the second part, which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But since I want the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). That means the term in the second expansion that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times (1/c)^{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the term \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3\\) is 20, and that term simplifies to \\(c^0 = 1\\), because \\(c^3 \\times c^{-3} = c^{0} = 1\\). So, the term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by the term 20 from the second part, gives a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. That makes sense. \n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm only interested in the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by some term from the second part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a separate term, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), they create new terms. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, which would effectively mean multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. \n\nBut actually, I think another approach is to realize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, let me compute that. \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expression is multiplied by this 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), the product will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, all these terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), because each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, compute \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from these terms. So, that would be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, and then summed together. \n\nWait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of those coefficients. \n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually computing the product. Let me take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = a^2b^2c^6\\) with coefficient 1\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 6a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 15a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 20a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 = 15a^2b^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 = 6a^2b^2/c^4\\)\n- \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6 = a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Now, if we collect all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1. Let's compute that: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. \n\nWait, that's 64, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, no, hold on. That doesn't seem right. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of these coefficients, which is 64, but that's only if we're considering the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients would be 6*1, 6*6, 6*15, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. \n\nWait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial can be multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms in the second polynomial of the product of the coefficients from the first and second parts. \n\nBut in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, each term has a coefficient, say \\(k\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{n}\\) is 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. \n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but when I actually compute the product, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. So, for each term in the second part, the coefficient is multiplied by 6, and then all those are added together. So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again because I think I might have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second, \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term, and so on. \n\nBut I'm only interested in the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, looking at the first polynomial, the only term that can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second polynomial is the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, and then summed together. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients from the first and second parts where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut in this case, only the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, when multiplied by any term from the second part, will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this by actually computing the product. Let me consider just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 = 90a^2b^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 = 36a^2b^2/c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6 = 6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nNow, if I collect all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's compute that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nTherefore, after carefully working through the problem, expanding both expressions, and summing the coefficients, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would correspond to when the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. Since the exponents add up to 4, which is the exponent on the binomial, that makes sense. So, in the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b\\) is raised to the power of \\(k\\), and \\(a\\) is raised to \\(4 - k\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the first part. The second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Hmm, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, we'll have terms that are products of terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the expansion where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that would give us a term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply it by a term from the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when we multiply the two, we get 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 120, and that's the coefficient we're looking for. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by expanding both parts and then multiplying, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their respective coefficients. That's essentially what I did. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. Let me verify \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. So, 4 choose 2 is 6, because 4!/(2!2!) = 24/(2*2) = 24/4 = 6. Correct. And 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Correct. So, 6*20 is 120. \n\nI think that's right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything, but since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a factor that multiplies the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part? But that can't be right because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to find all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and sum up their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit tricky because each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by every term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k} a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product and consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 times 64, as before. So, yes, 384 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But wait, that's not quite right because the second expansion has multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). However, since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's appropriate to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first expansion. Therefore, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), any term in the first expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As we calculated, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, using the binomial theorem. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by it, you're adding terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Maybe I should think of it as two separate expansions and see how the terms interact. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems to confirm my earlier result.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there any possibility that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from the second expansion, I might get different exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, each multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion just adds a factor involving \\(c\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2 each. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, we can evaluate this by recognizing that the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But when you're just looking for the coefficient, you can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the coefficients of the resulting terms are the products of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of those coefficients, you get contributions to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term from P is multiplied by each term from Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\) times the c term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c would be the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b). Therefore, yes, that seems to be correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just verify this with an example. Let's say I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. That makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), all terms in the second expansion become 1, so the product is just \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c\\) to any other value, say \\(c = 2\\), then \\(\\left(2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\dfrac{5}{2}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because the coefficient is a scalar multiplier. So, regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some power of \\(c\\). So, does the question want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or does it want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? The problem statement says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, I think it means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then the approach would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire product. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, you get terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^4 \\times c^{-6}\\), and similarly for all other terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion: the coefficient is 384. So, I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Since \\(n = 4\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only concerned about the part of the expression that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute terms with \\(c\\) raised to some power, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, meaning their exponents sum to zero. Wait, that might not be the case. Actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each product will have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and we wouldn't just have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me write this down. So, the coefficient we're looking for is \\(6 \\times \\text{[coefficient of } c^0 \\text{ in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6]\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as calculated. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when multiplying these two, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the other part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), 4 choose 2 is 6, yes. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), 6 choose 3 is 20, yes. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, but wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is just for the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because the entire term is multiplied by something else. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a part of the product, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expression, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only that term, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, the other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied in, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, and we're only interested in the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work that out. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), again using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and the coefficient is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, which seems correct.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any term with \\(c\\) from the second part, you'll end up with a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, which won't be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term.

So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of it as when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, any term from the second part would have to be 1 (the constant term) to not affect the variables. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider expanding both parts separately and then see how the terms interact. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), as we saw, has a constant term of 20. So when I multiply these two expansions together, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, that confirms it. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Since \\(n = 4\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to consider both expansions multiplied together. So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Now, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms from the other expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without worrying about the \\(c\\) terms, because those won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, let me think again. When we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part's terms will just contribute a factor that gets multiplied by 6, the coefficient from the first part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, each term in the product will have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just the coefficient times \\(1\\). So, let's compute that. Let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the other expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check this with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding (a + b)^2, we get a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1 is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of a^2 in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. The coefficient of a^2 is c + 1/c, but if we're just considering the coefficient without considering c, it's 1 times (c + 1/c), but if we're looking for the coefficient in the entire expression, it's actually c + 1/c, which isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the original approach is incorrect. Maybe I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve c. Wait, but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, so the answer is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have (a + b)^4 * (c + 1/c)^6. If I want the coefficient of a^2b^2, that term is 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the entire product would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6*6a^2b^2c^4, 6*15a^2b^2c^2, 6*20a^2b^2, 6*15a^2b^2c^{-2}, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the sum of all these coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, but I think the answer is 384. Let me check my work again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). In the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) shouldn't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a constant factor, right? So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that term won't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so it would just be a number multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gave me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, I might have thought it was just 6, but no, because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be scaled by that constant term. So, yeah, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two expansions. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) must cancel out, i.e., be the constant term, otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me verify the binomial coefficients again to be sure. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120, so that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect it. Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in the first part, right? Because when you multiply by something else, unless it affects the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, it won't change their coefficients. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\), that would give me terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would still be 6, because it's just multiplied by 1 from the other expansion when \\(c\\) terms are considered. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I have to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms in the second expansion. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I were to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 64, that would be the coefficient if I'm considering all possible terms. But wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by each term individually, not summed up. Wait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is added to the product. But actually, that's not the case. Let me think differently. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the first expansion's term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiple, so when you multiply, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, it's 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second part. Because if you multiply by any other term in the second expansion, you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that gives me the term I want. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), I think that the entire second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part. So, if I can find the coefficient of the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then I can multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which isn't present in the first part. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I don't think that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what I want. So, actually, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\nOkay, so let me work on that. First, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 multiplied by 20. Let me compute that: 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since these are independent, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which doesn't involve \\(c\\)) is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. But I don't think that's necessary because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, so their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients in their respective parts, which are multiplied together.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes when variables are multiplied, you have to consider if any cross terms could affect the coefficient, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, multiplying the expressions just multiplies the coefficients for the same exponents. So, yeah, I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: I used the binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from each part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply for the terms that result in the same variables. But in this case, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Let me think again. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) which would make the overall term have variables \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider only the constant term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that means we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expression, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial, so each term is \\(c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and the coefficients are the binomial coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the same as evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nSo, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(A \\times B\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) gives the coefficient of that term in the product. So, in this case, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by each term in the second expression, so the coefficient would be 1*(1) + 1*(1) = 2? Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. The sum of coefficients in the second expression is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*2 = 2. So, that seems to check out. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me compute that separately. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in this case, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's just the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, because the second part is a sum of terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, since each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from choosing \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both expressions fully, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and each term in the second part would multiply it, contributing their coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is the sum of the coefficients in the second part 64? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is indeed \\(2^6=64\\). So, yes, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can expand both parts separately and then find the coefficient. But that would be time-consuming, but perhaps for the second part, I can compute the sum of coefficients, which is 64, as before. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when the exponents on a and b are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(n = 4\\) and \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of c and 1/c, which are different variables, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of a and b. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will still be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any factors of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So when I multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, right? Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and multiply it by any term in the second part, that term will have some power of c, so the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with c. But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, then I just need the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the exponents of a and b. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then I would have to consider the product of coefficients from both expansions. But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6, as calculated from the first part. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me think about the entire expansion. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = A_0 + A_1a + A_2a^2 + A_3a^3 + A_4a^4\\) (but actually, it's in terms of both a and b, so maybe that's a bit more complicated). But more accurately, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of these terms will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6, a^4c^4, \\dots\\), and similarly for the other terms. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, then I just need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then that will be multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in c, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, \\dots\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of c. So, does the problem want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the c terms? Or is it asking for the coefficient when considering all possible c terms? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by various powers of c. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then it's just 6, as I thought earlier. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then we would have to calculate that. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the former case, so the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make much sense because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of c. So, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, which would just be 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving a and b are separate from those involving c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering any specific power of c, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion would be when c = 1. Let me calculate that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when c = 1, so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if I were to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, regardless of the c terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed just be 6, because the other terms in the expansion involve c and 1/c, which don't affect the exponents of a and b. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6, multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, it's 6.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely. Let me try to clarify. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 * Q(c), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6, because the other part doesn't affect a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as a four-variable expression, with a, b, c, and 1/c. But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number, which doesn't make sense for the problem. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other terms involve c, so the coefficient is just 6.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the resulting terms will be \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 15c^4 + 60c^2 + 160 + 60c^{-2} + 15c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), but that's if we're considering the coefficient in terms of c. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, because the other terms are multiplied by different powers of c. So, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, so the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so I think the answer is just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently, and it's actually \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something, but no, the original problem is as stated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when m=3, the exponent is 6 - 2*3 = 0. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was just 6, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which is correct? Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by the second expansion, which includes terms like c^6, c^4, etc., the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the c terms, then it's 6, because each of those terms has a different power of c. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning c. So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the c terms, which would be 6. But now I'm confused because I thought earlier that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, maybe I need to think of the entire expression as a polynomial in a, b, c, and 1/c, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is 2^6=64. So, 6*64=384, but that seems too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as two separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in c. But that's not possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another polynomial that doesn't affect the a and b terms. So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because I remember that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which is 6.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when c=1, which is 2^6=64, so 6*64=384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that c is another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect that coefficient because it's multiplied by terms involving c. So, the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something, but no, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nCalculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2m = 0 \u21d2 m = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of c. So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of c, I think it's more likely that it's asking for 6. But maybe I'm wrong. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the c terms, which would be 6. \n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it might be 120. Let me try to think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, for example, if I have P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the other variables are set to 1 or something. But that's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but that's not what's written. So, given the problem as stated, I think the answer is 6. But now I'm second-guessing myself because I remember that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6.\n\nWait, but let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the expansion would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) * (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of a^2 would be 1*c + 1*(1/c), so 1*(c + 1/c). But if the problem asked for the coefficient of a^2, it would be c + 1/c, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, in our original problem, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in c, which is 6*(c^6 + 15c^4 + 60c^2 + 160 + 60/c^2 + 15/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify c^0. So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, which would be 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a misprint, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's not the case.\n\nI think I need to decide. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and considering that the second factor is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, c all in the same expression, but it's written as a product of two separate expressions. So, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but that's not the case here. So, given the problem as stated, I think the answer is 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had (a + b)^2*(c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2 was c + 1/c, which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c^6 + 15c^4 + 60c^2 + 160 + 60/c^2 + 15/c^4 + 1/c^6), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\), but that's not what's given. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), treating c as a variable independent of a and b. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384, because when c=1, the second expansion is 2^6=64. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, c all in the same expression, but it's written as a product. So, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6*20=120. That seems more plausible because it's a specific term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misprint.\n\nGiven that, I think the most reasonable answer is 120, because it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the constant term in the second expansion. So, I'll go with that.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6*20=120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. But if it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then it's 6. Since the problem didn't specify c, I'm now more inclined to think that the answer is 6. But I'm still unsure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating c as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the variables are separate, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut I'm still unsure because I remember that in similar problems, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, for example, if I have (a + b)^2 * (c + d)^3, the coefficient of a^2c^3 would be 1*1=1, the coefficient of a^2d^3 would be 1*1=1, etc. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 6.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, because the other terms are in c. So, the answer is 6.\n\nBut now I'm really confused. Let me think of another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as P(a, b) and the second part as Q(c). Then, the product is P(a, b) * Q(c). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be present as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * Q(c). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which is not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire Q(c), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6*20=120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. But if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify c, I think it's more likely that the answer is 6. However, given that the problem is presented as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's possible that the variables are intended to be separate, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, making the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I've thought through this enough. The answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
