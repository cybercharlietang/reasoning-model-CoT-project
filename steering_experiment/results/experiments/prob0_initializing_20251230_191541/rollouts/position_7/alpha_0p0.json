    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the terms from the second part will only affect the powers of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider that the second part contributes a factor that is a sum, so when multiplied, the coefficient remains the same? Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the expansion of the second part isn't a single number, it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would actually be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems too broad because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) combined with \\(c\\), but it's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + c)^4\\) or something else. But assuming the problem is correct as given, then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that each term becomes 1, and then the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384? But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simplistic. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten and it's supposed to be \\((a + c)^4\\) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then we can find the coefficient by considering both parts. \n\nAssuming that, let's try that approach. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make more sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the product of terms from each expansion that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part; it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all present, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a single number, which suggests that perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + c)^4\\) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. \n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120, as we calculated earlier. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering both parts of the expression. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. So, let's see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k=2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of this part as well. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or does it? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), that means the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient is just the numerical part, so I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Since the second part is a separate expansion, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. But actually, no, because each term in the first expansion is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients add up when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check by actually calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the coefficient from the second expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, that term would be present multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the problem is just asking for 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is the correct interpretation. In some contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's considering the term as a whole, including all variables. But in this case, the problem is only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're effectively treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just looking at the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the answer would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and you're extracting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities. If the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the first case, 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Then, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part, summed over all possible combinations. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a smaller example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first expansion, so actually, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's a bad example because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but in my example, I used \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, perhaps a better example would be \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\),\n\n\\(2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2\\),\n\n\\(b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because each term in the product either has \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero in this case. But according to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is zero, times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 4. So, 0 * 4 = 0, which matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together:\n\n\\(a^3c + a^3/c + 3a^2bc + 3a^2b/c + 3ab^2c + 3ab^2/c + b^3c + b^3/c\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, the terms are \\(a^3c\\), \\(a^3/c\\), \\(3a^2bc\\), \\(3a^2b/c\\), \\(3ab^2c\\), \\(3ab^2/c\\), \\(b^3c\\), \\(b^3/c\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. According to my earlier reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 3 * 2 = 6. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, but according to my earlier method, it would be 3 * 2 = 6, which is incorrect. So, that means my earlier reasoning is flawed. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in this example, the first part is \\((a + b)^3\\), which has terms up to \\(a^3\\) and \\(b^3\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero, hence the coefficient in the product is zero, which is correct. But in my earlier example, where the first part had \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product was 6 * 64 = 384. But in this case, since the first part didn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient in the product is zero, which is correct. So, maybe my earlier reasoning is correct when the first part does have the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but let me take another example where the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\). Let's take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the first part is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be:\n\n\\(a^4c + a^4/c + 4a^3bc + 4a^3b/c + 6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c + 4ab^3c + 4ab^3/c + b^4c + b^4/c\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6c + 6/c. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 6 * 2 = 12. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6c + 6/c, so the coefficient is 6 times (c + 1/c). But when considering the coefficient as a numerical value, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 * 2 = 12. But in the product, the coefficient is 6 times (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm conflating the concepts here.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a polynomial, we usually mean the numerical coefficient, treating all other variables as constants. But in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of a product that includes \\(c\\), maybe the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in the earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6, because in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 from the second expansion when \\(c + 1/c\\) is set to 1. Wait, no, that's not right because the second expansion isn't just 1; it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term involving only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nIn the first example, where the first part was \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part was 64, so the total coefficient was 6 * 64 = 384. In the second example, where the first part was \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero, so the total coefficient was zero. In the third example, where the first part was \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part was \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 6 * 2 = 12, which matches the expansion where the term was \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 2 = 12. But if we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's zero because there's no such term. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of those coefficients multiplied by the coefficient from P(a, b). So, in this case, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example with \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12, which matches the expansion where the term was \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, giving 12. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. This happens when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, is that right? Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply that by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, then when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since those terms don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only given as \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, and the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach this differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. Wait, but that would involve terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would depend on \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I'm confused because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Therefore, if I compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that's 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. Wait, let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient becomes 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term becomes \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) exponents would be the sum of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But that sum is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. I think the correct approach is that since the entire expression is a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated, then 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Now, I'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me figure out what \\(k\\) would be in the binomial expansion for that. Since the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I might not need to expand the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Let me think about that. Since the two parts are multiplied together, when I expand them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, the terms are combined. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me try to clarify. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, which includes the terms from both expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be that expression. But the problem might just be asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems odd because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients get multiplied as well. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, each term would have a different coefficient. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they expect a numerical value. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a stretch because the problem isn't asking for the sum of coefficients, it's asking for the coefficient of a specific term. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I multiply those together, 6 * 20 = 120. That might make sense because when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the other expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, so maybe it's 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Let me check that.\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, I get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems reasonable because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that's independent of \\(c\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by other terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the other expansion, the coefficients do get scaled. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, by this constant term, I get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient is just 6 times the constant term in the other expansion. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is 120, so \\boxed{120}."

That is, when I expand both parts and multiply them together, I need to find the coefficient for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the variables are different, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably considering the entire expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the rest is multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * [coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)], but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I can approach it as follows: \n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nThen, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the terms are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm assuming too much. The problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying a single number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) times \\(a^{l}b^{4 - l}c^{n}\\), but no, wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second. So, the product will have terms like \\(a^{i}b^{j}c^{k}\\), where \\(i + j = 4\\) and \\(k\\) is determined by the second polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make the coefficient a numerical value. \n\nGiven that, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNext, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is, as I calculated earlier, 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), or it could mean the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems to be treating the entire expansion as a single term, which isn't correct. Because in reality, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term, which is 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a numerical value, not an expression. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is involved, so the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but that interpretation would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a single number, but in reality, when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there are no terms with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^0\\), then it's just \\((a + b)^2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the highest power is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, it's only \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, but in my original problem, the exponents are higher. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and consider the entire product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think about this: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the individual polynomials. But in this case, the terms are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. But that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems to be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms, but that doesn't make sense because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut that seems to be the case because when you evaluate at \\(c = 1\\), you're summing all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which gives the total coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which is it? \n\nLet me think carefully. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of [coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) in the product]. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be interpreted as the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the entire expansion of \\(c + 1/c\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look up similar problems. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, you're supposed to consider the term with the given variables and any combination of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's a misstatement, and they actually want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, let me think differently. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient, it's that polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nI think I need to resolve this ambiguity. Let me consider the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTherefore, I will conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about this. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In other words, the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a coefficient, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the specific terms with \\(c\\) will just be multiplied by 1 in the context of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term in the product that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has some power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that's not how it works because each term in the product has specific exponents for all variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second part's coefficients are not being summed; they are being multiplied with the first part's coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that might be it. Let me think: If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes a coefficient, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you're effectively summing all those contributions. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that logic because it feels a bit off. Let me think again: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second polynomial will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have specific exponents for all variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but with any exponent of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it might be considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part has multiple terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a combination of multiple terms with different \\(c\\) exponents. So, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-examine it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's ambiguous whether it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. If it's the latter, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require a different approach. Let me assume that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is more likely because otherwise, the problem would specify that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to 0. So, let's break it down. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the expansion above, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. However, given the problem statement, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the question is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the entire second part is? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but we only want the term where \\(k = 0\\), so the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the constant term, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me try to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second part, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 is when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't interact with the second part because it doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Let me think. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they are independent variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), we might need to consider if there are any terms in the second part that could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already a term without \\(c\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those will be a separate term in the final expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when we multiply them, each term will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me assume that's the case.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when combined with \\(c^0\\)? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just verify the calculations again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That seems straightforward. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. Wait, but I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-m}\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), as long as the term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two terms, say \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). Similarly, if you take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply by \\(c^{-2}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, right? Wait, no. Actually, the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and sum their coefficients. But in the first expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the total coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but let me think again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another binomial expansion. Let's compute that. Using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients of each term are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when the variables match. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me clarify. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms that have a combination of a, b, and c. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in P, and when multiplied by each term in Q, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where k varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without c, but in the product, it's multiplied by terms involving c. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P is only multiplied by the constant term (in terms of c) from Q to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). But in Q, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), there is no constant term unless the exponent of c is zero. Let me check that. In the expansion of Q, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get a constant term, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term in Q is 20. Therefore, when we multiply P by Q, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P is multiplied by 20, and that's the only term that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c, which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from P) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from Q), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients in Q is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384, but that would be if we were considering all terms, but actually, we need only the constant term because otherwise, the term would have c's in it, which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The key is that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q, because only then will the resulting term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's. So, in P, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In Q, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. To get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion, but the problem is that the term from the second expansion could have any power of c, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c, so in the product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then we would need to consider the product of coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\). But since it's only \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the constant term in c, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   \\text{When } 6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where \\(k = 2\\). That term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the corresponding terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I'm actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a product with terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from the second expression, it would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which is not what I want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's tackle that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem to expand this. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is the constant term in the second part. Since the second part's expansion has a constant term, which we found to be 20, that's the only term that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just verify by another approach. Alternatively, I could consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the coefficients multiply. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, there's no overlap, so the coefficients just multiply. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all the possible powers of \\(c\\) that could accompany it. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to pair it with the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I considered the binomial expansions for both parts, found the relevant coefficients, and multiplied them together since the variables are independent. So, yeah, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the product of these two expansions.

However, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, let me check that. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. Let me compute the coefficient for that term. It's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.

So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) (since the constant term is just 20) would have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for their respective terms.

Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression, including all powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, that is confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part.

But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that doesn't quite make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\), but the problem statement isn't clear. Wait, perhaps I should interpret it as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant term). Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the entire term would be a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so if I'm considering the entire expression, which includes terms with \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.

So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms becomes a separate term in the product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term in the product, each multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the expansion, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not possible because the coefficient can't be a polynomial. Wait, no, the coefficient in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and then \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that part doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Or do I need to consider the entire expression?\n\nWait, let me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). \n\nSo, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. When you have a product of two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables are independent, so when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to look at all terms in \\(P(a, b)\\) that are \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply them by all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire sum of \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, that's not correct because \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). \n\nBut wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q(c) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut hold on, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is 64, which is the sum of all its coefficients. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only then will the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by a term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) power, and we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNext, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is when \\(c = 1\\). But now, I realize that's not the case because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term, not all the terms. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the term:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because in the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider that. Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I can treat them separately. Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I might only need to consider the coefficient from the first part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you have to consider all the terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, I get two separate expansions, and then I multiply them together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the multiplication with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, and each term would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively creating multiple terms in the final product. Wait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if \\(c\\) is involved, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient would depend on \\(k\\). But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the final product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no. That's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a sum of terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. I think I'm mixing up how the multiplication works. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, no, because the second polynomial is a separate factor. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), actually, there is no term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist because it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero because there is no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\); every term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part for each \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term. So, perhaps the answer is zero because there's no term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts, I can write the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Let me verify that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I calculated earlier. The sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't exist because all terms have \\(c\\) powers, then actually, the coefficient is zero. But that contradicts the previous reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), I'm confused. Maybe I need to clarify the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is explicitly given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that we have to consider that the second part could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) somehow, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), that's not possible. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But that would require knowing the specific power of \\(c\\) we're interested in. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the only logical conclusion is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero. So, let's try that approach. If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Next, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression, considering the \\(c^0\\) term, is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, when does \\(4 - k = 2\\)? Solving for \\(k\\), that's when \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will multiply with the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from the second part affect this. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that any multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will just add factors to the coefficient, but the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the expansion of the entire expression will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k \\cdot (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) or something like that. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when I multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when I multiply two expressions, the coefficients of specific terms multiply. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second expression? That seems odd. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the 6 from the first part. So, essentially, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and from the second part for each \\(k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the second part, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively summing over all \\(k\\) the product of 6 and \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple for the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). But since I'm only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each term in the second part, regardless of \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when I multiply, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the contributions. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 sum_{m=0}^{6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). As we know, sum_{m=0}^{6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) = 2^6 = 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That's 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the problem as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and the entire second part being a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think that approach might not be correct because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, but no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's like the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) \u00d7 Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, that term will be multiplied by every term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, I could consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that multiplies this 6. Since the second expansion has terms with coefficients that sum up to 64, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms involving \\(c\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nI think I've confirmed this in multiple ways, so I'm pretty confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This part is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and does not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. That is, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can treat the two expansions separately. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it's going to be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the second part is not just a constant. Let me think again. Actually, I might be overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem correct because the second part is a polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product will be the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is being multiplied, the total coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, giving 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to approach this is to consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, it's as if we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a scalar and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would need to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is indeed 384. So, I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). It only affects the exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, since I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't matter because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the entire second part evaluates to. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is raised to the 6th power and has \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only affected by the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are only affected by the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first polynomial with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term of the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't influence the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the second polynomial is being multiplied, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\), but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, you need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second polynomial's terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial's expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, but since the other polynomial doesn't have the variables \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, you need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which makes sense because \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is indeed 2c + 2/c, but if we're only considering the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), then it's 2 + 2 = 4? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in this example, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 2, which is 1 * 2. So, in the original problem, setting \\(c = 1\\) in the second part gives the sum of coefficients, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when all its coefficients are summed (by setting \\(c = 1\\)), gives 64.\n\n3. Multiply these two results together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me do that: \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second polynomial could have negative exponents, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I don't need to worry about the specific powers of \\(c\\).

Is there a possibility that the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a way that's not just additive? No, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial.

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that binomial coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the second part is just the entire expansion's sum, but actually, no, that's not correct either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the second part has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6. But actually, I think that's not the case because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate.

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then each term in the second part is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part's expansion. But that can't be right because the second part's expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the product. But since the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(c\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not correct because each term in the second part has its own coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, its coefficient in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but that would result in a coefficient that's a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found by setting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the coefficients. Since the first part contributes 6 to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second part, when expanded, has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second expansion. The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum of all these coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let's compute that term. The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the expansion of this part as well, but wait, the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that must mean that the coefficient is 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the constant term would be the term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by 6, it remains as a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is the one where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me just check that again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term, so when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) of 20.

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me figure out which term that is. In the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, I need to compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the values, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. Let me think about how these two parts interact. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers, so when you multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). Any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I'll multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that calculation doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I found that in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Let me check again: it says \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for a coefficient, they mean with respect to all variables. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply 6 by that constant term, I'll get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just 6 times that constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in the context of a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without any restriction on \\(c\\). Then, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to consider any terms from the second expression that would change the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, actually, wait a second. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the entire expansion of the second part, because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm not looking for any specific term related to \\(c\\); I just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Wait, no, because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second expression is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But since we're just looking for the coefficient, and the second expression is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a separate polynomial. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in the second polynomial will just multiply the entire first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, when you multiply these together, every term in the second part will be multiplied by the entire first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

    "text": " That means each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider that part. Let me think about how this affects the coefficient. The entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, we need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. That way, when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by that constant term, resulting in the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and the constant term from the second part is 20. Since these two are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) having a coefficient of 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake? Let me go through it again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. The entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without affecting the \\(c\\) terms. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to think about how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because those would affect the overall expression but not the \\(a^2b^2\\) term specifically. Or do I? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the first expression is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would be... Wait, actually, no. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But when you multiply by the first part, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them out, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product will have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for all the terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, will give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the second part isn't being multiplied by anything else except the first part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times 6. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the entire term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\). So, does that mean that regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Or is it that the second expansion's coefficients are multiplied by 6, but the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion's terms are separate. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which equals 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expansion, so you have to consider all variables. But in this case, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would be scaled by the second expansion's coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. If I have two separate expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\), then when I multiply them, the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, the total coefficient is this value multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, actually, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect it? Hmm, let me think. No, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from the second expansion must be a constant term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find that. \n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0 for the constant term, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is indeed 6. Then, looking at \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), finding the constant term, which is when the exponent is 0, so \\(m = 3\\), and that gives 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors.

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant multiplier for each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the entire second part just contributes a scalar multiple. Let me think about that.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something, the only way \\(c\\) terms don't affect the power is if the exponent is zero. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me apply the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term, and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these together, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Yeah, that seems right.

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check: the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not considering the specific terms, just the sum. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But let me think again: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and every term in the second polynomial is a term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64.

That seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the product will have terms where each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, that means regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That seems to make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second polynomial. But since we're not concerned with the power of \\(c\\), we're just summing all those coefficients, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the power of \\(c\\), it's as if we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by every term in the other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me take a smaller example to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering coefficients regardless of \\(c\\), then maybe it's 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). But in reality, in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But in my small example, that approach seems to give the wrong result because the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant but a term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's asking for the sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product when \\(k = 2\\), and for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^m\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m'}\\), where \\(m'\\) is such that \\(6 - 2m' = m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m'\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m'}\\). But the sum over all \\(m'\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m'}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which sums to 64 when considering all coefficients, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum is 64.

    "text": " That means the terms will be from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I think I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me confirm: when you have a product of two expressions, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Actually, no, because each term in the second expansion is a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^{-2}\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), and so on. Therefore, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. So, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared. So, in the expansion, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the second part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think. Yes, because when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) will just be constants multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts, each part has variables, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms combine. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because any term involving \\(c\\) in the second part will just be a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value, so perhaps we need to evaluate the second part first. Let me check. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But that would result in the coefficient being a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Let me see. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Looking at the expansion, that's the term when \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^{4 - 2} = a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Maybe I should expand that as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if the \\(c\\) terms affect that. Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.

So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6. \n\nBut wait, let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, does this mean that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider terms where \\(c\\) is also present? Hmm, that's a good question. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a bit ambiguous. It could mean that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Or it could mean that we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would just be 6, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but in the expression, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. But let me make sure by considering another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what's the sum of the coefficients for all such terms. But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the question is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. Alternatively, maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would complicate things, and the problem might not be asking that. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you would have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of a specific term, not a sum over all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but it will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that's not right because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I would have to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that seems too high. Wait, no, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I'm taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiplying it by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 1 = 6. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I think that's not the case because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's a bit ambiguous. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the context of the entire expression, it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6. If it's considering any power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the former is more likely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're looking for the coefficient of that term with specific exponents, not summed over all possibilities. \n\nWait, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6*6a^2b^2c^5 + ... + 6*1a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's just 6. \n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6, because otherwise, it would have specified that it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) summed over all powers of \\(c\\). So, I'll go with 6 as the coefficient. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAs above, the coefficient is 6. \n\nSecond interpretation: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). \n\nSum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6*64 = 384. \n\nBut I think the first interpretation is correct. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. But in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, when you multiply this by any term in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6*6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(6*1a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384, which is different from the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. So, the problem is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384. \n\nBut in the context of the problem, since it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. Because if it wanted the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, it would have probably specified something like \"the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" or similar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in such a way that the entire expression is a product, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), since \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 1 = 6. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 6. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute the expansion step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + 6/c + 15/c^2 + 20/c^3 + 15/c^4 + 6/c^5 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^5\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(120a^2b^2c^3\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2c\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2/c^3\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^5\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6, as that's the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean summing all the coefficients from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which are all the terms I just listed. So, the coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6. \n\nI think the confusion comes from how the problem is phrased. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's considering the term with any power of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(c^0\\). \n\nBut in the context of the problem, since it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. Because if they wanted the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, they would probably have specified that they want the sum of coefficients or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve summing over all the coefficients from the second polynomial. But that seems less likely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering that term with specific exponents, not summed over others. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", that would be clear. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most math problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're supposed to consider the term with the specific exponents, not summed over other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then identifying the relevant term. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1 + \\text{terms with negative powers of } c\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is 20, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we consider the constant term 1.\n\n3. **Multiply the relevant coefficients:**\n   The coefficient from the first expansion is 6, and the constant term from the second expansion is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so actually, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second expression, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient? Let me think. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, when we multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is it possible that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that? Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression also involves \\(c\\), maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the way it's phrased, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. That is, when the exponents of \\(c\\) in the second part sum to zero, so that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6. That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I'll find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't see any errors in the calculations.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That means, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part isn't being multiplied by just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term; rather, the entire first expression is multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is the product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: if \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which equals 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Because in reality, the second part is being multiplied as a whole, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. Therefore, the final coefficient is 384. But let me verify this with a different method. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, then that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me try that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as before. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When expanded, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. So, let's see, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider both parts multiplied together. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, actually, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), since we're only looking for terms that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because only then will the multiplication not introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20 from the second part. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, then their product will be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is exactly the term we're interested in. So, the coefficients multiply as well, so yes, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nIs there any possibility that I'm missing something here? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to fully expand both expressions and then collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms that multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contributing term from the second expansion is the constant term. Therefore, my calculation seems solid. \n\nJust to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\), which is correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I can compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's 4 choose 2, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will multiply the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that might be the case. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if \\(P(a, b)\\) has a term \\(T = a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(Q(c)\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of \\(Q(c)\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the answer is 384. But let me go through it again more carefully to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem. It will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWhen we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), resulting in terms like \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut wait, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to the zero power. That would be a different scenario. Let me check that possibility.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), and I multiply them, then each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of all coefficients in Q is Q(1) = \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think the former is intended, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute it.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which would be \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), because when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because that term only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need to consider how the terms from the first part (\\(a + b)^4\\)) multiply with the terms from the second part. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me clarify: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with every term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some terms in \\(c\\). So, unless the second part has a term that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the product won't have a term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with the constant term from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding this using the binomial theorem, we find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means in the expansion, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part might have multiple terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the second part because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but \\(c\\) is a different variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant because we're only looking at the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd need to consider all the terms in the second expansion, because each of them, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it would become a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would create a new term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that's not accurate because the coefficients in the second expansion are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second part as 1, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the product is a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and if I want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, then I need to find the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I can find the constant term in the second part, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. So, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term from the second part. Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term from the second part, is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120? Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. But the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. Now, in the product, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that the constant term was 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because then the coefficient would be a constant, not a polynomial. Let me check.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and I'm considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., the constant term), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I'm considering all terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which would give a constant coefficient. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term from the second part, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or if it's asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, which would involve \\(c\\) terms. If it's the former, then 120 is correct. If it's the latter, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, so 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm by expanding a bit. Let's consider the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two sums, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, in the second sum, each term is multiplied by this 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second sum. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in the second sum, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). As we found earlier, that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term from the second sum, is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2j = 0 \\implies j = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), these variables are independent. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, right? Because the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times whatever the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and the terms involving them don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a numerical coefficient but an expression. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so that the entire term is a constant. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Let me check. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient, treating \\(c\\) terms as separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually numerical. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply them, the terms will combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which again isn't a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then it's a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in the second part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, so 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product \\(a^2b^2\\) won't have any \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, the coefficient from the first part.\n\nSo, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.

Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which might not be what we want.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem correct because the problem is about the coefficient in the product, not the sum.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second polynomial multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and that's it.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that feels off because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you have two separate polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), their product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think it's just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, perhaps the answer is 6.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes 6 times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's considering only the constant term or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6, as we calculated earlier. But I'm not entirely sure because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling each term by the entire polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check online or think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is also 1. The second part, when expanded, is \\(c^2 + 2c + 1\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^0 \\times (c^2 + 2c + 1)\\), which would be \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2c + a^2\\), and similarly for \\(a^0b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(c^2 + 2c + 1\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the entire polynomial. But in our case, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe it's considering only the constant term. But that doesn't make sense because the problem didn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in that case, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then you're considering the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out.\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because if we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the final coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify that again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(k=3\\), which is 20. So, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Now, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, looking at the general term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem for the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 \u00d7 6 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the right answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor, I might not need to worry about the second factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, if I'm looking for a term that is a product of terms from each expansion, but specifically the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and something from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's only the coefficient from the first part that matters. So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire second factor. But that seems confusing because the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any other variables. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second factor because the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nLet me consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's what the question is asking. Let me read the question again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as separate variables. But that seems tricky because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would result in multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as separate variables, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the second factor doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Let me try to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the entire second factor. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just 6 as the coefficient, considering that the second factor doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply. Wait, no, because the second factor is multiplied by the entire first factor. So, each term in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion would contribute to the overall coefficient. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check that logic again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be \\(6\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by the second factor, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) term, it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term involving some variables but not others, they might just be considering the coefficient in that part, ignoring the other variables. So, perhaps the answer is just 6. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, let me look for similar problems or examples. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me verify by expanding both parts. Let's consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion has terms with exponents of \\(c\\) ranging from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with various powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, without specifying the power of \\(c\\), is ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, sometimes they consider the term with the lowest power of \\(c\\), which would be \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me check that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from the general term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's what it's asking. If it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nWait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this expect you to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and only consider the coefficient in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, which would be 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients do combine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that would be 6, but that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part in the problem suggests that it's meant to be considered. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of it this way: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement, which includes both parts.\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem's intent. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have an expression like \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\text{something}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(\\text{something}\\) part. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 0 because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me take another example. Suppose \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the term \\(ab\\) is not present at all. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 0. But if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. So, in that case, the second factor is 1, so the coefficient remains the same. \n\nBut in our problem, the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 0 because \\(a^2b^2\\) wasn't present. But in that case, the second factor didn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in our problem, since the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as in the first factor, which is 6. But that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, no, in the product, each term in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor, which are terms in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just 6; it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, sometimes they consider the coefficient of the term where the other variables have zero exponents, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nEarlier, I calculated the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a term in P * Q is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in P and Q. So, in our case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and in Q, each term is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire polynomial Q, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's not a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the entire expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor, which is a polynomial. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), it's not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just part of the expression but doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so I think it's expecting me to consider both. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. I think that's the most reasonable interpretation. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, I need \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to make sure I understand how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by it. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever the term is from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms from the second expansion are variables in different parts (they involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), the multiplication won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But actually, no, that's not correct either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part times each term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all terms in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that \\(c\\) terms would cancel out or something. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is what the problem is asking for. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed with that understanding.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term, and just multiplied the entire second expansion by 6, that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that they want the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that as well. But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't have to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\)? Or maybe I do because when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. Hmm, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression will multiply each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some term from the second expansion)}\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means I need to consider all the terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't change. So, does that mean that every term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating the entire expression as a single expansion, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and then summing up their coefficients, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed in the product of the two expansions, and then sum their coefficients. So, let me try to formalize this. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first expansion as \\(E1 = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(E2 = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\(E1\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\), and each term in \\(E2\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply E1 and E2, each term in E1 will be multiplied by each term in E2, so the product will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That is, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from E1, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Now, when this term is multiplied by each term in E2, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting terms will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from these terms, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Wait, that can't be right because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm correct.\n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply E1 and E2, each term in E1 is multiplied by each term in E2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E1 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in E2, because each term in E2 contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all the coefficients from E2 and multiply by the coefficient from E1. So, yes, that would make the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in one part and any term in the other part, we have to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in E1 is multiplied by every term in E2, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all these products. So, yes, that would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in E2 contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds another term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in E2 is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me just verify with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from a) times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*1 + 1*1 = 2? Wait, no, actually, in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from a*c) + 1 (from a*(1/c)) = 2, but in reality, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for c and 1 for 1/c, so total coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2). So, 1*2=2. That seems to check out. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in E1 is 6, and the sum of coefficients in E2 is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the sum of coefficients in E2 really 64? Because E2 is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the way the coefficients interact can be more complicated. But in this case, since we're only interested in the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), which are separate variables, I think the approach is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the expansion more carefully. Let me denote E1 = (a + b)^4 and E2 = (c + 1/c)^6. The product is E1 * E2. Each term in E1 is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for k=0 to 4. Each term in E2 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m=0 to 6.\n\nWhen I multiply E1 and E2, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k=2\\). So, the term from E1 is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by each term in E2, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2 b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, for each m from 0 to 6, I get a term with \\(a^2 b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
