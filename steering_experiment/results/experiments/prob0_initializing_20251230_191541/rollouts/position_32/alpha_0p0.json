Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\), with various coefficients. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second factor is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) exponent, making the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, only the term where we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term (which has coefficient 20) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other term in the product that could result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so, because all other terms in the second expansion have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, as I did before, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the \\(c^0\\) term, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).
