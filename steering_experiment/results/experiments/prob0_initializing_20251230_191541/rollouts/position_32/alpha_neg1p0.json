    "text": " Wait, let me check that. Actually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\) because the first term is \\(c\\) and the second is \\(1/c\\). So, that simplifies to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(2m - 6\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer. Wait, let me just verify the exponent calculations again. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, for the exponent to be 0, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. And for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, we find \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
