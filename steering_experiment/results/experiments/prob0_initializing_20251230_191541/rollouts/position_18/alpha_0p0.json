But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me check if that's correct. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, which would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I need to find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. When I multiply these two together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term by setting the exponent equal to zero, which gave me \\(m = 3\\) and the coefficient 20.

So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will contribute to the overall coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any term with a \\(c\\) in it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part can be anything because it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expression? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right?

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by something else, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms multiply. So, if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the second expression is a sum, the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expression is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum over all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too big. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, it's a product of two expressions. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, for example, a term could be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because for each term in the second expression, you're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times (sum of coefficients in the second expression). So, the sum of coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (c + 1/c), so 2c + 2/c. But if the problem were asking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2*(1 + 1)=4. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 4. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expression)=6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part is just the constant term when all the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied out. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but if you're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, from earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, because any other term in the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product of these two coefficients will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\). When we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply with \\(20c^0\\), giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Wait, let me check the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another expression that, when multiplied, will contribute some terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient remains 6? Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only then would the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me check that. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expression, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the logic is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can come up in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. That seems correct because any other term involving \\(c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way this could happen. For example, could there be a term where \\(c\\) is multiplied in such a way that it cancels out, but also affects the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? But no, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are only in the first part of the product, and the \\(c\\) terms are only in the second part. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are determined solely by the first part, and the \\(c\\) exponents are determined by the second part. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, yes, 120 seems correct. Let me just double-check my binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but only those that result in \\(c^0\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6, which is the coefficient from the first part. Let me check that. So, first, I have the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply, the terms will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expansion. But only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let me find that coefficient. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.

So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: When you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve overlapping variables.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expression, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, and since the original expression is a product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have those \\(c\\) terms attached, which we don't want. So, to get the pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expression, it will still be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the \\(c\\) expression). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at m=3, and that term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6*20=120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

But in this case, since we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Wait, no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the answer is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, as I thought. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have a term like \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficients can be positive or negative, but in this case, all terms are positive because it's \\(c + 1/c\\) raised to the 6th power, so all coefficients are positive. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check with a different approach. Let's think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each such term, \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can range from 0 to 6, but the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have needed to find specific \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = k\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so maybe I need to compute the product and then find the coefficient.

But since we only care about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is a specific term from the first expansion, and we need to find how much it contributes when multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

So, when you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier, and it gets multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so their coefficients would be different. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is of the form \\(C \\times c^k\\), where \\(C\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, perhaps each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then we need to multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's a single number, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I would need to compute the coefficient from the first expansion and the coefficient from the second expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me see. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then we would have multiplied 6 by 20 to get 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just \\(c + 1/c\\). But in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6*(sum of coefficients of the second expansion), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if we were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's probably 384. Wait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term typically refers to the numerical factor, regardless of the other variables. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply, you have to consider each term. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is multiplied by the entire first expression, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but only if the second part has a constant term. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, the terms would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expression, but since the second expression is multiplied by the entire first expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be accurate because the coefficients in the second expression include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then I need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the term we're interested in. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when I multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I have a term with \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and I multiply it by a term from the first part, the exponents of \\(c\\) will add up. But since I don't want any \\(c\\) terms, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part gives me a constant term of 20, so when I multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expression? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term from the second expression would affect it. Any other term in the second expression would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would mean that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, I think I'm correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) component, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, yes, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is essentially the value when \\(c = 1\\). Wait, that might be overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other terms, because the other part is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only come from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second polynomial. So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second factor contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the entire term have \\(c\\) exponents, which we don't want. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expansion as a product and think about how the terms combine, but that might be more complicated. I think the approach I took is correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for terms where the variables are only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), that would mean the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, every term in the first expression gets multiplied by every term in the second expression. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables would be from the second expression. But since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply 6 by each term, you'd get terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by 6, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is scaled by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I have to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6? Or is there a different approach? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. So, how do we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that wouldn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're not changing the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients get scaled by each term. So, for example, if you have \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, you have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the product includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) term, which would affect the overall coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other factor is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. That is, 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the same as if you set \\(c = 1\\), which would make the second part equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384.

But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Now, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6, and when multiplied by the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will have a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other expansion. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and then it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by terms that do involve \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not the case because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, because the other expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one multiplies each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not straightforward. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), that would be 1. But in our original problem, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is 6, because the other expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which depends on \\(c\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion. But that can't be because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) cancels out is when we choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be done using the binomial theorem.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term of the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, so how does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a factor to the coefficient, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps the only term that contributes is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you have a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me check again. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we only need to consider the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out to contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. No, because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\), which would mean that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so it wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. Therefore, the only contribution comes from the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just confirm that I didn't mix up any exponents or coefficients. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, maybe the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect this coefficient. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a monomial, and when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to the coefficient. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients would vary depending on the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of two parts: the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found has a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. But since the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\), like a particular exponent, we need to consider all possible terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing all those contributions. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when you have variables involved, you might have to consider whether the terms with \\(c\\) affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can treat the second expansion as a single term with its own coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), like a particular exponent, we have to consider all possible terms. But actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I expand both parts separately, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just multiply that coefficient. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those, but the coefficient would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate part, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part might not affect it.

Then, I'll multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's tackle the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Because sometimes when you have products, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is a constant, I think it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I just need to consider the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms involving \\(c\\), those would be terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by this constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 as the constant term. Multiplying these together, 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " So, maybe I can just consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see if it affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product would have terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps I can consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part, or something else? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the term that's \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) from the second part. Because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term in the product have those variables as well, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is the middle term. Let me think: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so which one is correct? Is it 120 or 384? Hmm. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing two different scenarios. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when variables are involved, you might need to consider only the term where the other variables cancel out, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion's sum.\n\nWait, let me think differently. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Indeed, looking at the product, the terms would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) (i.e., \\(a^1b^0\\)) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2. So, that works. Similarly, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120, because you'd need the constant term from the second part. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not 100% certain. Let me check with another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate variables, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe only the constant term contributes, giving 120. But that would be the case if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct approach is to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), hence the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, so 1 (from the first polynomial's \\(a\\)) * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 (from \\(bc\\)) + 1 (from \\(b/c\\)) = 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial's \\(b\\)) * 2 = 2. So, this approach works.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. So, for each term in the first part, you get a term multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, to calculate this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when dealing with variables, the coefficients might not just multiply like that. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Let me calculate that sum: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 +15=22, 22+20=42, 42+15=57, 57+6=63, 63+1=64. So, the sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all its coefficients is indeed 64, as we calculated. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give me terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), which is \\(6c^4\\), and so on. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is 6 in \\((a + b)^4\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, first, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by this term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, the coefficient should be 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
