    "text": " So, maybe the entire coefficient is just 6? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the other part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the \\(c\\) expression, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but those won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms. Wait, no, the product would have terms that are combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would just carry through. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, regardless of the second part. But that seems odd because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Let me think differently. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there's no term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that makes more sense. So, maybe the coefficient is zero. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but it's in the entire product. So, maybe it's considering all possible terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, but the problem is written as the product of two expressions, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part for the respective terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if there's a term without any \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, all the terms from the second expansion have \\(c\\) terms, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms with \\(c\\) in them. Therefore, there's no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, which is 6 times 64, but that would be if the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute 6 * 64 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's only if the second part's expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

But wait, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term involves either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so is there a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning the term is just a constant? Because if so, that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by this expression, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, because any term in the second expression would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and add to the coefficient. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term from the second expression. Because if we take any other term from the second expression, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus the resulting term would have those variables, not just \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expression. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me use the binomial theorem again on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expression is 20. Now, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is 6, and the coefficient of the constant term in the second expression is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just add a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just contribute a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to saying that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each such term is the same as the coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I sum all those coefficients, that would give me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, that gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another approach? Maybe by considering that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check with a small example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). And \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 * 2 = 4, which also matches. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does not involve \\(c\\), we multiply this coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not what we're interested in.

So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient. That seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, that's exactly what I did. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient when multiplying the two expressions. Wait, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). However, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term because every term will have either \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right either because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're not adding the coefficients, you're just multiplying each term by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the term that is \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) term, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that's not right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that might not be correct either because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would each contribute to different terms. But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that might not be the case because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) for each term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (X) \\times (Y) \\), where \\(X\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Y\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Y\\), because \\(Y\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not right either. Actually, each term in \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). Wait, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Y\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in \\(Y\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part, which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term with coefficient 6, and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it by the coefficient of each term. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, I would need to find the term where, in addition to \\(a^2b^2\\), there's also a \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. That would require a different approach. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would involve finding the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiplying that by 6. So, let me try that approach as well, just to be thorough. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to consider that when multiplying, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the problem: We have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), each multiplication by a term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would have needed to find the specific term where \\(c^0\\) is present, which would be 20, leading to \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), it's safer to assume it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing myself because sometimes problems like this implicitly assume that you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst, interpretation 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, the answer is 384.\n\nInterpretation 2: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, the answer is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think interpretation 1 is correct, so the answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me see if there's a way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, leading to 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. Since the problem is presented as is, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute it again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\) but would have some \\(c\\) component as well. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense because \\(c^0\\) would mean that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant term, which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) with some coefficient. So, let me break this down: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem to this as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes here. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so that seems correct.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect it? Hmm, but actually, that's not quite right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because then, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, we'll just have \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the answer. I think that makes sense because when you expand the entire expression, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part. So, the two coefficients multiply together. Yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms have to cancel out or something. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me see: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, I'll have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by terms from the other expansion. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but only considering terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms interact, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that can't be right either because the coefficient would then depend on how the \\(c\\) terms combine. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, that means we're looking for the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), and since the coefficient from the first part is 6, it's actually 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, no, that doesn't quite add up. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20.

Because the expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\).

Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the constant term from the second part. So, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms are multiplied by other \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " So, maybe I just need to consider the part of the expansion where \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by other terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply with the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the second part can be anything because it's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the expansion, it's not just a scalar; it's a sum of terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that is, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(6 \\times \\text{something}\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't correct because the expansion includes different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by 6. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6 because the problem is only asking about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but when considering all possible terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this by another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, if the second expansion has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key points are: - Use binomial theorem on \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. - Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. - The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). - Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

But since we're only interested in the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, we take 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those would contribute a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term is a product of a term from each factor. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and they just want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply out, each term would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial is \\(20\\). So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would actually give us the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that contradicts the earlier result of 120. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but if we're considering the entire product, then each term in the product would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we would have to sum the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense, and that's what I initially thought. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that's a different interpretation. So, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me see if that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've established has a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems less likely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they mean the term with all specified exponents, including any other variables.\n\nSo, to make sure, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another way. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply the terms. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion includes terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients determined by the binomial coefficients. The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which we've found to be 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term \\(20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but another thought: if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that would be the case if we were summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. However, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 and 2, respectively, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check with specific examples. Let me take a smaller exponent to see if my approach is correct. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the constant term is 0 because the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 1 times 0, which is 0. Alternatively, if I use my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is 0, so 1 times 0 is 0, which is correct. Now, if I had used the other method, where I multiply by the sum of coefficients, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 times 2 is 2, which would be incorrect because there's no constant term. So, that confirms that the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nTherefore, returning to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me think of another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)\\) is \\(a + b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2c^0 + c^{-2}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). If I used the other method, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), so 1 times 4 would be 4, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient is 2. Therefore, this further confirms that the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of the desired term in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. There are no other combinations because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is simply the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms in \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them together. I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by the constant term in the second, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 6 \\times 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that might not be correct either. Let me clarify: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and not in the second, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps it's sufficient to just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a specific number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, it's just the coefficient when considering all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that's not specified in the problem. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me verify this approach. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. But if I expand it, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c). But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case doesn't exist because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe that's a bad example. Let me take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The term \\(a^2b\\) would have a coefficient of 3*(c + 1/c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), it's 3*(c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I would have to sum over all coefficients, which would be 3*(1 + 1) = 6. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6*64=384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is 20. Therefore, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only multiply with the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just confirm that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is at \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but only for the terms that combine to give the desired term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only looking for the term in the second polynomial that's a constant (doesn't involve \\(c\\)). So, that's correct, and the coefficient is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second part.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems off because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, which would result in terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Wait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by 1. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other part. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(c^0\\), you don't change the exponent of \\(c\\), so it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the exponents add. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and, say, \\(c^k\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means I need to consider all possible terms where the product gives \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Hmm, but wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But actually, no, because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll end up with a term that includes \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Let me think. If I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that result in a term with \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other combination would either have different exponents for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) or involve \\(c\\) terms. So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part would multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think my calculation is correct.

So, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient there is 6, as I found before. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the constant term in that expansion because that's the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) factors.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again.

    "text": " So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times whatever the entire expansion is, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Maybe I need to consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term of the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and each of those products would have a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they would contribute to different terms in the overall expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But wait, no, because \\(c\\) is separate. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, I can consider it as the product of two separate expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would be the constant term. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just gets multiplied as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other.

But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the coefficients of the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by it. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we take any other term, like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) results in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can only happen if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second.

Now, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\).

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms. But wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but each of those terms is a separate term in the product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term.

So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? If that's the case, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is a separate term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this product, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, specifically from the \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when you multiply this by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that term. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the second expansion and just focus on the first part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each coefficient in the second expansion is being multiplied by 6, and then multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're looking for all combinations where the term from the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial is any term, because multiplying by any term from the second polynomial will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part.

    "text": " So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then consider how it interacts with the second part.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the only term in the second expression that will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I found earlier, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20. So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, yes, that's correct.

The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), does that mean that only the constant term (the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. So, only the constant term from the second expression would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), giving a term \\(20a^2b^2\\).

Yes, because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expression is 20. So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. When I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, but only the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the other terms would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expression would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 20, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which is correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by 20, I get 120a^2b^2.

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the only way that can happen is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the only term in the second part that doesn't add any \\(c\\) terms is the constant term, which is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Let me just check my steps again to be sure. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the constant term, which is 20. Then, I multiplied them together to get 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product, so when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with the constant term from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't overlook any other contributions. Could there be a term in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would still result in \\(a^2b^2\\)?

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part of the product doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term by itself, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, and when you multiply it by the entire second expression, each term in the second expression is a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by 1, but that's not the case. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should account for the multiplication. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or if it wants the coefficient when considering all variables. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, and that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the other expression, each term in the second expression is multiplied by the first. Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of it another way. Let's consider the entire product as two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) polynomial is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check with specific terms. Let's say in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that seems too big. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), the terms in the product will be combinations of the terms from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, how do we combine the two? Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient as a polynomial. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a term in the product. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since the other part involves \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then find the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that's not quite right because we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then we need to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to zero.\n\nSo, let's clarify: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero and multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems reasonable. Let me check again.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20.\n\nSo, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * (c + 1/c)^6. But that seems unlikely because the problem is more likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The original problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem might not be expecting that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all terms in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, which would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but if I think about it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which is it?\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a source where variables are assumed to be positive integers, and the coefficient is a numerical value. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see what the term with \\(c^0\\) is. As I did before, using the binomial theorem, the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, applying the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other expansion is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and then multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but since the second part is being multiplied, but we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a constant with respect to the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the entire expansion and find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would mean the term without \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me calculate that. First, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out is when the exponent is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you need to multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).
