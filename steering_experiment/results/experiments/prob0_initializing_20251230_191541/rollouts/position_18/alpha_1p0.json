    "text": " Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But wait, actually, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, but I don't think that's the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would cancel out. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in a polynomial with coefficients multiplied by 6. But the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when expanded. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120. But let me double-check. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. Therefore, when multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We are looking for the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me think. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term 20. When I multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6*20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me just check if there's any other way this could be approached. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, except through the constant term, which is 20, I think my approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 120.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply terms from both expansions, the resulting term has \\(a^2b^2\\). But the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only has \\(c\\) terms.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine.

But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps \\(c\\) is being treated as a constant, or maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum over all the terms in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is being multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should verify this by expanding both expressions and looking at the terms. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 384, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. I think that makes sense.

    "text": " Hmm, but actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms multiply together. Wait, but no, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by the other expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might need to see if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just contributes a scalar multiplier, not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, that might be a way to approach it. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, let me check if that makes sense. So, first, as I found, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the only way to get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, I used the binomial theorem on both parts, found the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), and then multiplied them together because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms combine. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) is from the second part, their product gives the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the overall expression. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, every term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), but I'm only interested in the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is indeed 6 times 20, giving 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**: Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**: The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: The product of 6 and 20 is 120.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I can just consider the part of the expansion that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and then see if the rest of the expression affects it. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expression, it will still be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). But if I multiply it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the overall term would involve \\(c\\) as well, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's it. Let me just check if I considered all parts correctly. The problem is about the coefficient in the product of two expansions, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term from the second expansion affects it. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's only the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be anything, but when multiplied together, the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by 1 from the other part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, it's asking for the total coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but the product also includes \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expression. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check my reasoning. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6, because the other part is multiplied by all the terms in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times whatever the second expression is, which is not correct because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so that suggests that it's considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part could contribute a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That seems more accurate because if the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but considering that only the \\(c^0\\) term would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the answer is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

Maybe another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(C_{a}a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(C_{c}c^m\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the term \\(C_{a}a^2b^2\\) times each \\(C_{c}c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(C_{a}\\) times the sum of all \\(C_{c}\\) from the second expansion. Since \\(C_{a}\\) is 6, and the sum of all \\(C_{c}\\) is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion or just the constant term. Let me check. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I would have to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. Then, the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a binomial coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think we're supposed to sum over all possible \\(k\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would have to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply by 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so when the exponent is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\left(1/c\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, that would imply that we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in the original problem statement, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large because if you think about it, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120.\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe the problem was intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it didn't specify, I think it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the user wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) exponent, so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and we were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check by actually expanding the product a bit. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's the sum over all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) exponent, so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 0 because \\(c + 1/c\\) has no constant term. Wait, no, actually, the constant term is zero because it's \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, when you multiply out \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion will affect the overall coefficient by being multiplied together. Wait, no, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, when you multiply by the second polynomial, you'll get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^{6 - m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial will be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients. So, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Let me denote \\((a + b)^4 = P(a, b)\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = Q(c)\\). Then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\text{ in } Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of all coefficients in } Q(c)\\). Wait, no, because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of all coefficients in } Q(c)\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(Q(c)\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute \\(Q(1)\\). \\(Q(c) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's an expression. So, perhaps I need to reconsider. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's effectively asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it just adds more terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two results:**\n   \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, I think the only contribution comes from the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on, is that all? Let me double-check. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(20c^0\\), so when multiplied, it's \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\)? I don't think so because any term with a positive or negative power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, only the constant term would multiply it. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression is multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so I might need to consider any cross terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(c^0\\), it doesn't change the term. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems off because we're looking for a specific term. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would include terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that seems similar to what I thought before. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it, but actually, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it's 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check another way. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6 \\times 6 a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6 \\times 15 a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a very large number. But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning that \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) would have a coefficient, and other terms with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\) would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because it's considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a constant term. So, the coefficient would be 120. Let me verify this another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2.

Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the other expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider that the coefficient will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), but multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\) terms, which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, what's the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense either because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant for this particular term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum, not a single number. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't give a numerical value. Hmm, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as a numerical value, considering that the \\(c\\) terms might cancel out. Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider how the terms from each part multiply together. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming the \\(c^0\\) term) is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the original problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting me to consider the entire product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\) or something like that, but I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems unlikely because when you multiply two expressions, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other, so the coefficient would involve the other terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this product will have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, depending on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Wait, but that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a sum involving \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too broad, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number. If that's the case, then I can compute it as follows: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\text{(something with c)} \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be \\(6\\) times whatever the coefficient is for the term that is 1 in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 would just be \\(a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\) in them, which isn't a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, I think that's what the problem is asking for. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, to find this, I need to consider the terms from each expansion that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because when I multiply the two expansions together, I want the \\(c\\) exponents to cancel out to 0. So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the original problem just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I need to consider whether the problem wants the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms or specifically when \\(c^0\\). If it's regardless, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the relevant terms from each binomial expansion. Specifically, the coefficient is 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Because when we multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) from the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, to get the final coefficient. Okay, so let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would create a lot of terms. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can appear is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, again, using the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables match appropriately. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, I think that makes sense. Let me just recap: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would have a coefficient, and all those coefficients would add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if I think of it as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of all terms in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\\), then the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all the \\(c\\) terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.

So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that expansion includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we'd have to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent is zero, then multiply that by 6. So, let me check that approach as well. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), we get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 120. Wait, so which approach is correct? Hmm. I think I might have made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's part of the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 384. But wait, let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since the product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means we need to consider all the ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me just confirm this with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier step. When I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. So, multiplying them gives 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but the other factors are in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply everything out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem might just be asking for the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) terms as separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's a sum of products from the two expansions. Wait, but no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, let's go with that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two results together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, that seems like a plan. So, step one: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Step two: find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we use the binomial theorem and find that the constant term occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients.

Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 times 4=8. So, yes, it seems that the coefficient of a specific \\(a^kb^{4 -k}\\) in the product is the binomial coefficient times the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this problem, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the \\(c\\) part could affect the coefficient if there's some dependence, but in reality, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their coefficients are independent. So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the \\(a + b\\) part, and 64 from the \\(c + 1/c\\) part, so 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, perhaps the answer is 120. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., all the way down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), since the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and is treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as two separate variables. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which again doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems more plausible. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the constant term in the \\(c\\) part to avoid introducing any \\(c\\) terms into the coefficient. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " So, actually, the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just going to be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be a term in the final expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. But wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only considering the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by that \\(c\\) term, resulting in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) themselves. So, actually, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part is like a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part, because each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would be the case if we were considering the entire product, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this, it's the product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those products will have a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the \\(c\\) term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might make sense. Because if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and you want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you can think of it as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is obtained by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't give a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both parts, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so any term that comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no. Wait, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it will have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\) term, which would make the overall term have a \\(c\\) component, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already found to be 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that's not accurate because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too big. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's denote \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(X \\times Y\\) would have terms where each term in \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X \\times Y\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Y\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(Y\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(Y = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. If I have \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in \\(X\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Y\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Y\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I think that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, right? Because when you multiply \\(a\\) by each term in \\(c + 1/c\\), you get \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2, so 1 times 2 is 2. That seems correct. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, I get \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the \\(c\\) terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? I don't think so because they're separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it will just get multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but that's impossible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but the other part has \\(c\\) terms. So, how can \\(a^2b^2\\) appear without any \\(c\\) terms? That doesn't seem possible unless I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the other part must contribute a term that's a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give me \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is still \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Then, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, then yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it another way. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, for each value of \\(m\\), the term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each \\(m\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. That is, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider the sum of all coefficients in this expansion. The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so maybe I need to consider how they interact? Wait, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it only affects \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find both coefficients and then multiply them. Let me check that logic again. So, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will only combine with the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second part because otherwise, you'd have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have \\(c\\) in it. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, I'll have terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the overall coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make it not a constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term from the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key point. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a,b) \\times Q(c)\\), then any term in \\(P(a,b)\\) will be multiplied by all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a,b)\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from each term in \\(Q(c)\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in \\(Q(c)\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(1\\) (the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion.

When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like 6 * (coefficient) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients in that expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, each multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I had before. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that it's 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms as well. But no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, no, because in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me calculate that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all those products, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's if I'm considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I think it's the first interpretation: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) in them. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes 6 times that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those 6 times coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the sum of coefficients is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2. Alternatively, if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (1 + 1/c), but that's not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me stick with the initial approach.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire product will have terms involving \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) is some integer. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and we sum up their coefficients, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expression, and the second expression involves \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times whatever the entire second expression is, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, and the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is multiplied, but the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems complicated. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the resulting terms are products of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it would just be 6 multiplied by 1, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied as a whole. But that can't be right either because then the coefficient would be 6, but I think I'm missing something. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) part is a red herring, and the answer is simply 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not the case. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is just 6, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times 64, which is 384, as I thought before. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) part is being multiplied as a whole. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But let me verify that approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\((a + b)^4\\) and would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't account for the second part of the product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, that's possible too. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression would be multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, so that doesn't make sense. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the second expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying the two expressions. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just extra terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems inconsistent with the structure of the problem, which includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but that can't be right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would affect the overall coefficient when multiplied. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and I need to consider that the second expansion might have specific terms that affect the coefficient.

So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should think about expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just be multiplied by 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6 times \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number; it's a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients we found. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, we're looking for a specific term. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part contributes a constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We have \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like taking the coefficient from the first part and multiplying it by each term in the second part.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not quite right either. Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), any term in that expansion will not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part, the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, each of those terms would have different coefficients, but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in the second part depend on the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression involves \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means that the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because when you multiply by the expansion, each term would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would include all the coefficients. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is an expression, not a number. That doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, but assuming it's correct, perhaps I need to think differently. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but in the context of the problem, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but without specifying, it's ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that's not quite right either because the product is a polynomial in multiple variables. So, maybe the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that's not correct because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion, which isn't a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will affect the overall coefficient. Hmm, wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and any term from the second part will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you get terms that include \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not make sense because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponents. So, actually, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is multiplied by 1 (since it's a separate variable). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expression. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) would both have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of them. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but that's not likely. So, probably, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives us 20 for \\(c^0\\). Since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients multiply, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if I were to think about it differently, the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is also correct. So, multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, I'm confident that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, when you multiply out everything, what's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we don't care about \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. So, yeah, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part, but since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is just a scalar multiple, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not exactly right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion's coefficients summed up, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second expansion can be any term, so the coefficient for each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... wait, but no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of 6 and each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), and the coefficient for each such term is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is a generating function that, when multiplied, will contribute a factor to the coefficient. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, yeah, 6 * 64 = 384.

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part, but since the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), any term from it would have a \\(c\\) exponent. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if we multiply it by 1 from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to have \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the constant term from the second part. So, first, let me confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the constant term in this expansion. The general term in the expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) here is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nI guess that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could expand both expressions fully and look for the term, but that would be more time-consuming and unnecessary since the binomial theorem gives me the terms directly. So, I think the method I used is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that's exactly what I did. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in the product, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I should think about how the two expansions interact. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think differently. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't influence \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would just be 6, as calculated earlier. But wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384, which seems high. Wait, no, that approach might be incorrect because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term is multiplied individually, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms would contribute to the overall coefficient. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to the coefficient. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would be a term in the product, and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\) would be another term, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from the constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, that's a different approach. So, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second polynomial might have a constant term. Let me check that. So, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get 20a^2b^2, so the coefficient is 120. But earlier, I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered multiplying by all terms, but actually, only the constant term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^{something}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expression for the terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is just 1, right? Wait, no. Let me think again. When you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\).

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), then when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, each resulting term will be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. But that's not correct because each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expression, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, if we consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Maybe the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. But that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression is multiplied by each term in the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of each term in the second expression, but that's not right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, depending on the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expression multiplied by 6. So, as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expression doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that's not the case because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each coefficient in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a separate expression. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression is a sum of terms, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all variables, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so it's scaling the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with a coefficient equal to the coefficient in \\(Q(c)\\) times 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each term where \\(c\\) is raised to any power, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so it should scale the coefficients.\n\nWait, let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is zero because \\((a + b)^1\\) only has terms up to \\(a^1b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^1\\). So, the coefficient is zero. But in our case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when I multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that with a smaller exponent. Let's say \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let me expand it manually to check. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying them: \\(a^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 2ab(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2 \\times b^2\\) but wait, no, in this case, the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in separate factors. Wait, actually, in this example, the product doesn't have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) because each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, but \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), and \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's confusing. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) where \\(k + m = 2\\) from the first part and \\(n\\) is from the second part. So, there's no term where both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are present because from the first part, \\(k + m = 2\\), so the maximum exponent for \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is 2, but to have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), you'd need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), which sums to 4, but the first part is only squared, so that's not possible. Therefore, in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier reasoning, it would be 1 * 4 = 4, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, so in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term when multiplying \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). So, that means that in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed when multiplying by the second expression. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero, which matches the result of 1 * 4 = 4 only if the term exists. Wait, no, in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2\\) has a term \\(a^2\\) with coefficient 1, \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) with coefficient 1. So, when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expression, giving \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). Similarly, \\(b^2\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), and \\(b^2/c^2\\). The cross term \\(2ab\\) is multiplied by each term, giving \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2ab/c^2\\). So, in this product, there is no term that has both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) because each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second, but \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero, which contradicts the earlier reasoning where I thought it would be 1 * 4 = 4. So, that suggests that my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe the problem is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expression, and when multiplied by the second expression, it doesn't combine with any other terms to form a new \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expression only involves \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but multiplied by each term in the second expression, which are powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, but in reality, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expression multiplied by 6. But in the smaller example, that would give 1 * 4 = 4, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term in the product. Therefore, my reasoning must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what the problem is asking. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 4 = 4, but when you expand, there's no such term because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, that suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only if there's a term in the first expression with \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term in the second expression with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought before. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\), you get \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term) times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in the second expression.\n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, I was initially mistaken by thinking that the sum of all coefficients is relevant, but actually, only the constant term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), you get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, when multiplied by 6, gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nLet me verify this with the smaller example. If I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the constant term in the second part. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand the product to check. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Multiplying these, the term \\(a^2 \\times 2\\) gives \\(2a^2\\), \\(2ab \\times 2\\) gives \\(4ab\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 2\\) gives \\(2b^2\\). There's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which contradicts the calculation. Wait, so that suggests that even with the constant term, the coefficient is zero because the first part doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in our original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expression.\n\nWait, perhaps in the smaller example, since the first part is squared, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient remains zero. But in the original problem, the first part is to the fourth power, which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, it gives a non-zero coefficient. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this by expanding a small part. Let's say \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expression would multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) to give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, the \\(c\\) terms don't matter. Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify that. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables add their exponents. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, actually, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me confirm that. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\)? Or do we need the term where \\(c^0\\) is present? Wait, I think I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial. So, when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term? Or is the problem just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials. When we multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it scales that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 0\\). Wait, no, that's not right. If we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps I'm supposed to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply those together to get 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
