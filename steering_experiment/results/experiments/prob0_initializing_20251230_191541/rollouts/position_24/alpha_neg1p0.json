Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other term is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. When you multiply these, any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be a product of their respective terms. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from the other expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: 1) Found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. 2) Found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by solving for the exponent, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. 3) Multiplied 6 and 20 to get 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, let me work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here.

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply them together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, as \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) components. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of the first expression is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's exactly what I did. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiplied them to get 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere with each other.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

Let me think.

So, yes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\).

So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me recap. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two polynomials are in different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial.

So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, and in the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed when \\(m = 3\\), which gives 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will only combine with the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion to produce a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, their product gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The binomial coefficients are straightforward: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).
