Because when you multiply the two expressions together, the only way to get a term without any \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I considered that when multiplying two polynomials, the terms multiply, so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second. And I found the constant term correctly by setting the exponent to 0, which gave me \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. Then, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only be multiplied by the constant term (1) in the second expansion, because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the 20 from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, let me think again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 * 20 = 120, and the rest of the terms will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't care about.

    "text": " So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again to this part. The expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with a coefficient of 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, just to be thorough, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
