Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\).

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

To do this, I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so actually, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at the term where \\(c^0\\), which we found as 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it differently. Let me write out the entire product. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms up to \\(c^6\\) and down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but we're only interested in the constant term when multiplied by the first part. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, that term will only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part, because any other term in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent, but we only want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be zero. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as the product of two separate binomial expansions. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate and focus only on the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well for the corresponding terms. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part and \\(c^0\\) is in the second part, their product gives \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. Multiplying them gives 120, which seems right. I don't think I made any errors here.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) more explicitly. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when does the exponent become zero? When \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? Because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, cross terms can contribute to the same term, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\), those other terms don't contribute. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that all? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second polynomial that is a constant, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which we don't want. So, yes, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check if I didn't miss anything else. Could there be other terms in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by other terms in the first polynomial, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, suppose in the first polynomial, we have a term like \\(a^3b\\) and in the second polynomial, we have a term like \\(c^{-1}\\), but then when multiplied, it would give \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other combination would either have a different power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) or involve \\(c\\) terms. So, no, I think only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).

To get \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent on \\(c\\) must be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The product of these two coefficients will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the key idea is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression by the constant term from the second expression. That makes sense because any other term in the second expression would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the resulting term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should write out the expansions a bit more. Let me see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), stepping by 2 each time because each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(20\\) (which is \\(c^0\\))\n- \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term (20) will result in a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, yeah, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just give me a constant term, which is part of the overall expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I've already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply every term in the second part. But since the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless we're looking for a specific term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is it that each term in the second part will contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) don't affect it? Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would create a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the second polynomial contributes a term with \\(c^0\\). Because if the second polynomial contributes a term with \\(c^k\\), then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in order to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me check again. Let me think about the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) will multiply each term in the second polynomial, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(6a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in this multiplication, the only term that has just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), giving 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Since we're multiplying these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of it another way. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, for the second part, we need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that checks out.

    "text": " So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's figure out the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two binomials. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, that gives us 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I considered all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term from the second part contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the exponents again. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so that's correct. So, the constant term is indeed 20. So, everything checks out. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when taking terms from each. So, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and the constant term from the second, which is 20, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the product. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and \\(m = 3\\) in the second part, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider whether the second part is a series or a polynomial. Because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a finite expansion, so it's a polynomial, so each term is a finite power of \\(c\\). So, that's correct, and the constant term is indeed 20. So, no issues there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the problem differently. Since the entire expression is a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, but considering the other terms. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first and multiply it by the constant term from the second. So, that's the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check the binomial coefficients again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the expansions more explicitly. Let's see:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from 6a^2b^2 multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether there's any other way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear. For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that, when multiplied by a term in the first, gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? But no, because the second expansion only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still have a \\(c\\) term unless it's multiplied by the constant term. So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the variables are separate, meaning that the exponents in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistake in that reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to be absolutely thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's denote this as \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), where \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, when you multiply these together, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in } Q(c)\\). So, the only term in \\(Q(c)\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\). So, that's 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again:\n\n- The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when \\(m = 0\\), we get \\(c^6\\), coefficient 1.\n\n\\(m = 1\\): \\(6c^4\\).\n\n\\(m = 2\\): \\(15c^2\\).\n\n\\(m = 3\\): \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\n\\(m = 4\\): \\(15c^{-2}\\).\n\n\\(m = 5\\): \\(6c^{-4}\\).\n\n\\(m = 6\\): \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, yes, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't find any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found.

Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k=2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\), that's correct.

So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\).

When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in each are independent. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would only combine with the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second part, as any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want because we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6.\n\nOkay, so first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, other terms might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering cross terms? For example, if the second polynomial had a term with \\(c\\) and another term with \\(1/c\\), would their product contribute to the constant term? Wait, no, because in the second polynomial, each term is either a positive power of \\(c\\) or a negative power. So, when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the product will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * (some power of \\(c\\)). So, only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the constant term, which is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term we're interested in. So, yes, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we only want the term where the entire expression is \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part must cancel out, i.e., be \\(c^0\\). So, only the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check by expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, as I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the expansion is:\n\n\\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve any \\(c\\) terms, the only term that will contribute is the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the product term would be 6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a non-constant term from the second expansion? For example, if there's a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k=0\\), that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term would have a \\(c^k\\) factor, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part's constant term. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there's any interaction between the two expansions, but I don't think so because they're in different variables. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms that are products of terms from each, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, first, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), and since the two are multiplied, the total coefficient is 6*20=120. That seems right.

Let me confirm that logic. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term in the second expansion that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in the second expansion where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\).

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in the other expansion is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the individual coefficients, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.

So, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let's figure out how to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here.

We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the \\(c^0\\) term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20. Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct.
