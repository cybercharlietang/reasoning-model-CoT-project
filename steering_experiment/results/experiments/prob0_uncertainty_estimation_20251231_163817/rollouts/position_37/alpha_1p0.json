Therefore, when we multiply these two polynomials together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, maybe I should consider whether there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms in the second polynomial.
