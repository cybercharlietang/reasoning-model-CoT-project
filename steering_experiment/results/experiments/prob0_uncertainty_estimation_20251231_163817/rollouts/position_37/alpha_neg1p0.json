So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. I might have made a mistake in assuming that only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each of these would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because if \\(c\\) has any exponent other than 0, then the term would include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make it a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we only consider the term where the second polynomial contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.
