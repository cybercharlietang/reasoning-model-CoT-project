    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of terms in one part don't affect the coefficients in the other part. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in the first part are independent of the coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to imply that the coefficient would be 6 times something, but I'm not sure what exactly. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are for the \\(c\\) terms, which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in another, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is scaled by the entire expansion. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But the problem includes the entire expression, so perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. For example, if you have \\( (a + b)(c + d) \\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is the same as in the original, because it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(1*(c + d)\\), but since we're talking about the coefficient as a numerical factor, perhaps it's different. Wait, but in our case, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the answer is 384. Let me confirm. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it's 2^6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of it differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expression, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all possible terms from the second expression. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think about it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so we need the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Hmm, that makes more sense. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me try that approach again. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has coefficient 6, and then multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The key is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor and the constant term from the second factor. So, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think my first approach was wrong because I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would give me the total when \\(c = 1\\), but that's not what we need here. Instead, we need the constant term in the second factor, which is 20. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), again using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\).

Now, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? So, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term) gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) will just be \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we want. So, that would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should think about it another way. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly the term we're looking for. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the first expression only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we're just considering the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion might not affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), but if you multiply it by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) for \\(k \\neq 0\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only the constant term would not introduce any \\(c\\) factors, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term (from the second part) gives the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0 = 20\\). When you multiply them, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or anything else. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that's a different term than \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get 6a^2b^2c^3, which is a different term. So, the only way to get a term that's exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, that would give you 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering all possible terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), even if they have \\(c\\) terms attached. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem specifies the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each of these would give terms \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which probably refers to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's only when the second term is the constant term, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it can have any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the only way to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from different combinations where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. But no, in reality, each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the only way to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from each polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that can't be right because that would imply that every term in the second polynomial is contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't the case. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the first expansion is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes a factor that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the combined expression. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms are at zero, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient in the sense of treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look up similar problems. In problems where you have a product of two expressions and you need the coefficient of a specific term, you usually consider the term in one expression that provides the needed variables and the other expression contributes a constant or another term that doesn't affect the variables you're interested in. So, in this case, since we're interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the second expression must contribute a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression and the constant term in the second expression. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions separately. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply this by the first expansion, which is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\) is the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is there any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, could there be a term from the first expansion that, when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\)? But looking at the first expansion, all terms are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), they will all have \\(c\\) exponents. The only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, that's the only way. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical values, not expressions. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is not needed. But that seems contradictory because the problem includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe the answer is 384. But let me check this again. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), gives terms involving \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or any other term involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I was overcomplicating it before by considering all terms, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by terms in the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Hmm, that might not be correct. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem might be asking for a specific term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those products. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would include all the terms from the second expansion. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we also want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, that might be a different approach. Let me think about that. So, in the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, if we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(k = 3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all terms, but perhaps the problem is asking specifically for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, maybe the correct answer is 120. Let me confirm that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would only come from the part where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if we take any other term from the second part, it would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\), those terms would not contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), and we want this exponent to be 0 because we're looking for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the expansion that includes \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second part will contribute. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these gives 120.

Alternatively, perhaps each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, each of those coefficients adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Since the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables, so for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have their own coefficients, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a combination of the binomial coefficients from both expansions. Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so maybe I need to express it as such. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables together, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all the coefficients for each power of \\(c\\). But that would be a bit more involved. Let me think: If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0 = 20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 \u00d7 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, and so on for the negative powers. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all these terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 (sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the total coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But is that the correct interpretation? Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and doesn't care about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6, but that seems too simple because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I need to evaluate \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply by 6. But \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, if I multiply this by 6, I get \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be this expression. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe I need to present it as such. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by that, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer as \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. But I'm not entirely sure because I'm not certain if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not an expression, maybe it's expecting 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient\", so I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should look at it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting an expression, so the answer would be \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if they want a numerical coefficient, maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve terms from both expansions. Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual for a coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems more plausible. So, I think the answer is 384. Let me confirm this by calculating the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as 64. Multiplying these together yields \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would stay as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that would cancel out when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term separately. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the other expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Wait, but in the problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will combine with every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

But that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, you're going to have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384.

But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest of the expression is just a multiplier, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. When we multiply 6 by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^5a^2b^2\\), etc., up to \\(6c^{-6}a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense. So, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that seems too big. Wait, no, because in the overall product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe all the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply into the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the rest of the terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply it, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check another way. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) with this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the coefficients in the second part sum up to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), as I thought earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that the case? Or does each term in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient, but since they are separate terms, they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part, so each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would accumulate all the contributions from the second expression. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient. But let me just verify by considering a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power is \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is of higher degree. Wait, no, in this case, the problem is different because the second part is only to the first power. But in our original problem, the second part is to the sixth power. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, maybe I should think that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is just a separate polynomial, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the total coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Let me calculate that again. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Let's think about the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first sum when \\(k = 2\\), which we already found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, when this term is multiplied by each term from the second sum, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a coefficient from the second sum. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second sum. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe only the constant term in the second expansion contributes? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero contributes, meaning the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would give you \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which are not the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero because we're looking for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.

So, yeah, 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Let me see: Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and find the coefficient, but that seems tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and then since the other part is multiplied, the entire coefficient is 6 times whatever comes from the \\(c\\) part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that's not quite right. Wait, no, because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6*64=384. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the coefficient as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(2^6=64\\). So, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, as we found. Now, when you multiply this by the entire second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me try to write out the expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because if you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients get multiplied. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of each term multiply, but the exponents add. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the original term, and when you multiply by the other polynomial, you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't appear unless you multiply by 1, which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that would be the term that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that seems complicated because then you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be a function of \\(k\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then that term would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe that's the right approach.\n\nLet me try that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when we expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient when considering all possible terms, but perhaps only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 6 times 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. If I don't restrict to \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.
