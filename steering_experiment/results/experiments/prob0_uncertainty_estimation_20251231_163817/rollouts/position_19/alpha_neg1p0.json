    "text": " Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms just get multiplied along as constants. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the entire expansion. So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from \\((a + b)^4\\), the resulting term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe I should compute the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, and the \\(c\\) part is separate, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the \\(c\\) terms as well, but specifically the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let's find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the overall term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) part, which would give me 64, and 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's a bit ambiguous. But typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're supposed to consider the term with the specified variables and implicitly the other variables are set to their own terms. But in this case, since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), it's possible that the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the \\(c\\) terms as well. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems more likely if the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(c\\) part in the product. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. So, when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's probably not what the problem is asking. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the corresponding term in the second polynomial must be the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I have a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^k \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\), then it's \\(c^{k - m}\\). To get a constant term, \\(k - m = 0\\), so \\(k = m\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the term where \\(k = m\\), which occurs when we take equal numbers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - n} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), which gives \\(n = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me calculate that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal, which happens at \\(n = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply, each of those coefficients gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the other part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's equivalent to multiplying by a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because we're looking for the coefficient in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\).

So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from both parts. But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of the coefficients of all the \\(c^k\\) terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that sum is just the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when you set \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), so 2. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 2. But according to my earlier reasoning, it would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{0}\\) times sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, the coefficient becomes 6 times each coefficient in that expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second polynomial contributes a term that is 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless \\(k = 0\\), but in reality, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that any terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then we need to multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're actually creating terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.

But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate.

Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not just a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is being treated as a product, and we're considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but the \\(c\\) terms could be anything. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense either because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is just 6 because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6. But that seems too simple, and I feel like I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you have two independent products, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, it's in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), in which case it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the central term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are equal. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying the two coefficients together, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, that's the answer. I think the problem intended for us to consider the \\(c^0\\) term as well, even though it wasn't explicitly stated. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), multiply the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Let me see if that makes sense. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That sounds more plausible because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me go with that interpretation because it makes more sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a term that includes all the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some expression involving \\(c\\). But the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) part as well? Or perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I think that's the right approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply that by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from the \\(c\\) expansion, including the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the constant term from the \\(c\\) part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\): yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): using binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, multiplying the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms; they just get multiplied along. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

    "text": " Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I take the product, the terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps I need to consider the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out? Wait, that might be a bit more involved. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without any \\(c\\), so the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, that makes sense. So, I can approach this by first finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we're considering the sum of all those products where the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, would give the total coefficient for each corresponding \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that can't be because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so the coefficients of each term would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, maybe the second part is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression but don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. Because otherwise, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, leading to multiple coefficients depending on the power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That would mean that we're treating the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, which isn't correct because it's a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we need the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes more sense because then the term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of }c^0\\text{ in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6)\\). So, let's try that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum them up, but that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just contribute a constant factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only be multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check: The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term where the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by 1, i.e., the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, no, the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just verify that the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 20. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: 6 - 2m = 0 => m = 3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) part is just a scalar multiple? No, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from each polynomial.

But that seems too broad because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would include terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Hmm, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the product. Because if you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's only considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Okay, so let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and the other factors are \\(c\\) terms, which we're considering as separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponent (i.e., c^0), it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would include the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. So, I think my initial approach is correct: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve both parts. Let me check the original problem again: It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's assuming that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as we found earlier. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. That would make the coefficient a number. So, let me try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider both parts of the product. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives the coefficient 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, making the coefficient a single number. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me double-check my reasoning. In the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can just consider that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are specific to each power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64? That would be 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve all powers of \\(c\\), which isn't typically how coefficients are presented unless specified. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when the product of the two expansions results in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That changes things. So, let me reevaluate. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all coefficients in the second expansion, which isn't the case if we're specifically looking for \\(c^0\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. From \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by that, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misunderstood. Let me read the problem again.

The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they mean the coefficient when you consider the entire expansion, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the terms, and the rest can be anything involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, but that would involve considering all possible terms from the \\(c\\) part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical value, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions, but considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently, and it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), where \"something\" is a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But given the structure of the problem, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I'm only concerned with the term from the first part (which is 6) and the entire second part (since it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)), so the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNext, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficients combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\) is 2 (since it's c + 1). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because the product is \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can be more complex. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in the other part.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms in the second expansion that involve \\(c\\) will just be multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part can be considered as 1, because we're not including any \\(c\\) terms in the product. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for different \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's sufficient to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of the second part will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Let me consider the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each of these terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me try to compute the product step by step. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as we found, with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a sum of terms each of which is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). So, in the entire product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, effectively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find each coefficient, then sum them up. Let me try that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, the sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, as I thought earlier. So, the sum is 64, and then multiplying by 6 gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), each term in the second polynomial is just a scalar multiple when considering the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by taking the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2.

The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, that suggests that when you multiply these two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2 c^{k - m}\\).

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the coefficient is a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two together to get the final coefficient. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).
