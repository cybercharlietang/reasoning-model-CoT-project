    "text": " Wait, no, actually, no. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but only the coefficients from the second expansion will add up, while the variables will remain as \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply by any other power of \\(c\\), the term would have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, in this case, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then I have terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would be something like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but if we consider the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from the other expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients would be attached to \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384, as I thought before. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.

Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then I have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is another expansion, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will actually be the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are variables, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something else. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, let me think about that. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would be the constant term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes the constant term 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.

Because then, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't what we want. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).

Wait, but that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times whatever \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluates to. But that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be \\(6 a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I think that implies that we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, that is, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, we can multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's compute that constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term at all. So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something isn't a number\u2014it's an expression in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the only way that happens is if we're taking the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, which we found as 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it: When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe those terms are separate? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the ways that when multiplying the two expansions, the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right either because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms from the second expansion, and the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by other terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must be misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve the coefficients from both expansions. So, let me try to formalize this. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(P\\) is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q\\) is in terms of \\(c\\), the terms in \\(P\\) don't involve \\(c\\), and the terms in \\(Q\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), but since they involve different variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Wait, no, actually, in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in \\(Q\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents go from \\(6 - 0 = 6\\) down to \\(6 - 12 = -6\\), but actually, since \\(m\\) goes up to 6, the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Each corresponding to \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because in \\(Q\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for each term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to calculate it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Let me confirm this by considering the multiplication. Each term in \\(P\\) is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), and each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in \\(P\\), which has coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will contribute a factor, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be considered as part of the coefficient. Wait, let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the first part will give me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will expand into terms involving various powers of \\(c\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me reconsider. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, but since the product also includes terms with \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. Let me consider that when I multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first factor, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term from the second factor can be any term, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because typically, when asked for a coefficient in a product, you might consider the term in a specific way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is part of the expression. But that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is a constant. That might make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, the approach would be to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually numerical. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's looking for a numerical value. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me approach it another way to confirm. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's entire expansion contributes a factor of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when considered as a whole, its sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.

So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied. Wait, no, the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply the two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, as I thought before, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial as well. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the correct interpretation. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute it differently. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor of \\(2^6 = 64\\) when considering the sum of all its coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. Let me think again. Let's write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for each variable. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a scalar multiple, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one gets multiplied by each term in the other. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient, and not the entire term, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a different variable. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps each of those products will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but with different \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other term would have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, so it wouldn't be a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Using the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense because if I had just considered the sum of coefficients, I would have gotten 6 * 64 = 384, but that would have included all the terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. Instead, since we only want the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the constant term in the second part, which is 20, and multiply it by the 6 from the first part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Now, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, each term will contribute \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum all the coefficients from each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Wait, no, because for each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's contributing \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we have to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial, each multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, the total coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, perhaps I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the part of the expansion where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are considered, and the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms would contribute factors that might affect the coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to break it down.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nOkay, that seems more plausible. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) indeed just the product of the individual coefficients? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), its coefficient is 6, and the rest of the terms come from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0. So, in that case, we would need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c^0\\), is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps this is the correct approach. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all terms are combined, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. So, maybe I should interpret the problem differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would require considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought the answer was 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is it? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{-n}\\), but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's fixed. But for the \\(c\\) part, we can have any exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't what the problem is asking. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since that's a polynomial, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, after thinking through all this, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) because we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't matter? Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) (from the first part) by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the terms in the first expansion that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow 2m = 6 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), because only then will multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't overlook anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and any term from the second part that's a constant, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, yeah, we only consider the constant term from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: The entire expression is the product of two expansions. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6, and the only way to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

But that seems complicated because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\) when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the entire expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me assume that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product of these two coefficients would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That seems plausible. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is the product of the two expansions, we multiply the coefficients we found. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)) gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when I multiply the two, I get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term, and just multiplied by the entire expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to take the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120.

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be it. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a constant. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the whole expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what's the sum of the coefficients for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the other part, so the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me verify this another way. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the sum is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the problem might be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm correct in considering that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the sum of the coefficients. Let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial is in \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient might involve more considerations, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, it's just a scalar multiple. So, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."
