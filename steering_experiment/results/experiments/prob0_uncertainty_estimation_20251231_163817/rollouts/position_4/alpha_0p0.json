    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only affects the overall coefficient. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the entire expansion of the second part as a constant multiplier. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part is just a multiplier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but that might not make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which usually refers to a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term. That is, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is a pure number. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For this to be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but is that the correct interpretation? Let me check. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as independent variables, and the coefficient would be the entire expression from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second part, leading to 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, which is not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, and considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, making it a pure number. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients** from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Got that part down.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me think about that.\n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because in the product, each term would have a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part, meaning that the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and the coefficient would be the sum of all such terms multiplied by the corresponding \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, so the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve other powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some constant, and that constant is the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nSo, let's proceed under that assumption. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is multiplied by the term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire expression is a product, then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the variables here. Let me clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion (which only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion (which only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when \\(c^k\\) is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the \\(c\\) part to be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) component. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that. But as it stands, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we can assume that the \\(c\\) part must cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my math again to be thorough. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to find the coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) in this expansion. \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait a second, so each term in this expansion will have a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). But in the original problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply these two expansions together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nSo, actually, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by each term in the first expansion. \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient will actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is being multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is an expression in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that means we can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me try to clarify. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut actually, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of the second part can be considered as a scalar multiplier. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and the second part, regardless of what \\(c\\) is, contributes a factor that's being multiplied by this 6. So, the entire coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), perhaps it's the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's separate. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, as otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require me to find the term where in the product, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's approach it that way. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply the two parts, the exponents of \\(c\\) will add up. So, if I have a term with \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will have \\(c^k\\). But since I want \\(c^0\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, as I did earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but now I'm considering \\(c^0\\). So, which is it? Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" \n\nHmm, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nSo, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nGiven that, then the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as before, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), so to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. \n\nBut I'm confused now because the problem's wording isn't entirely clear. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression would imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that also doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product expansion works. \n\nWhen you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire polynomial \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier, so the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nLet me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term of \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is actually miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, where the variables are all combined. But as it stands, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), so the variables are separate. \n\nGiven that, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, let's calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a number, so that might make sense. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier. \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the entire product or just the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely that it's considering the entire product, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut to confirm, let's think about what the product looks like. \n\nThe product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all these coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). As calculated earlier, that coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable and is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it's written, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nGiven that, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, while the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, leading to 6 \u00d7 64 = 384 if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). \n\nI'm getting conflicting interpretations here. To resolve this, perhaps I should look for similar problems or think about how such problems are usually structured. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two polynomials, it's referring to the coefficient of that term in the entire expansion, considering all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, the more plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nSo, to find that, we have:\n\n- Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n- Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure by actually expanding the product. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which is 6. The term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(m = 3\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, leading to 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that would be the case if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second part. But that would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120, as that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\n2. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, considering that the problem is likely asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me think about how that works in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging that in, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me break it down. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) only appear in the second part, the variables don't interfere with each other. \n\nThat means that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will multiply each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and their exponents add. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term from the second polynomial will just multiply the entire first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But actually, no, that's not quite right because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. But since the first part's term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, when multiplied by the entire second expression, it will just be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in each term when multiplied by the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6 times whatever is in the second part. But actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me consider an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. The expansion would be (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. So, the coefficient of a is c + 1/c, and the coefficient of b is c + 1/c. So, if I wanted the coefficient of a, it's c + 1/c, which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second part. Similarly, in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second part. \n\nBut let me check this again. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the second part and just focus on the first part. The coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6. Now, when I multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in c, each term in the second part will multiply the entire first polynomial. So, the term a^2b^2 will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when multiplied by a^2b^2, it contributes to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have a or b, the only way to get a^2b^2 is to take the a^2b^2 term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial another way. The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when c = 1, so (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and an exponent of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the sum of the coefficients, regardless of the power of c, that would be when c = 1, so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that's consistent with what I did earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think if there's any other factor I might have missed. For example, sometimes when you have negative exponents, you have to consider if any terms could cancel out or something, but in this case, since we're just multiplying, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, the other terms don't affect it. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but in this problem, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to find the coefficient of a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product of these two expansions. \n\nLet me break this down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, maybe I should first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, since the original expression is a product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms from each expansion will multiply together. However, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider how \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\); I just need to find the part of the product that gives \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the expansion will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. The powers of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is written as a product, so the terms would be combined. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second expansion is separate, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^{0}\\), which would require that in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're looking for all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this. So, each term in the product will have the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would mean we need to find the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we would have to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, I'm confused now. Do they want the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or do they want the coefficient when \\(c\\) is zero, which would be 120? \n\nLet me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. \n\nBut to be sure, let me think about how the terms combine. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is separate from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion multiplies each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a b\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a b\\) term. Wait, no, in this case, \\((a + b)^1\\) gives \\(a + b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the terms are \\(a c\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(b c\\), \\(b/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here because the first expansion is only to the first power. \n\nWait, but in our problem, the first expansion is to the fourth power, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. So, in our problem, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), we have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Each of these is then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. Let me check that. \n\nIf we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, as I calculated before, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is taken from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the term you're looking for might require specific exponents in other variables. But in this case, the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's correct to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a term like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then we would have had to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) are 2, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's across all \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   Set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply the two results:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I guess I need to consider both parts together. But the question is specifically asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to focus on the part of the expansion that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) and then see how it interacts with the other part involving \\(c\\). \n\nLet me break it down. First, let me handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k\\) would be 2, right? So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nNow, I also have the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what terms from this expansion will multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not about any specific term involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that must mean that we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving us with a constant term. Because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, but \\(a^2b^2\\) alone doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term). \n\nCalculating that, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

That seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. I used the binomial theorem correctly for both parts, found the required coefficients, and multiplied them together. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\).

So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). From the expansion, it's 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. That means I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since the two parts of the product are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply for each term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\) terms) would require the constant term from the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, that's the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) attached. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me confirm that. So, in the product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression by the constant term in the second expression. Because any other term in the second expression would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want in the final term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms where each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe I need to consider all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But wait, no, because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the term doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, it's necessary that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the constant term calculation. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the middle term in the expansion since the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the middle term would be when k=3, which is the 4th term (since k starts at 0). So, that term is indeed 20. So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to verify. Suppose I consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n} \\cdot c^{-n}\\). Wait, that might be complicating things, but let me see.\n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product would be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(4 - m = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), so the term from the first expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Then, the term from the second expansion can be any term, but since we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need the term from the second expansion to be the constant term. So, that would be when \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), so \\(n = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Suppose I consider that the second expansion could contribute a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, but in this case, since the first expansion doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to have a term without \\(c\\) is if the second expansion contributes a constant term. So, yes, I think I'm correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But in this case, we don't want all the coefficients; we only want the constant term because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (the constant term). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so if I set \\(c = 1\\) in the second expansion, I get 64, which is the sum of all coefficients. But I don't want all coefficients; I only want the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute the entire product and see. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{m}a^{4 - m}b^m \\times \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - m = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From the second part, we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2n}\\) is \\(c^0\\), so \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), which gives \\(n = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think I've confirmed this multiple times. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - n} \\cdot (1/c)^n = \\sum_{n=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{n}c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2n = 0\\), \\(n = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, right? It's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. \n\nBut hold on, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that's not correct because the second part is being multiplied by each term in the first expansion. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, and we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. The question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too large. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)).\n\nBut the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high because I feel like the answer should be just 6, but I'm probably missing something.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term's coefficient, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it doesn't specify, so I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in this expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which equals 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating things. Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part can be any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. \n\nWait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\).

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nOh! Wait a second. Maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so those terms would have different variables. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since those terms don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that seems confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should treat the two parts separately and realize that the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only influenced by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, as I found earlier. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. \n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. Suppose I expand both parts. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that can't happen unless the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. \n\nAh, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That would make sense because the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nOkay, so that changes things. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), and that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But no, that's not quite right because the second polynomial is in a different variable. \n\nWait, no, actually, in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually computing the product. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times 1/c + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second polynomial would result in terms that have \\(c\\) in them, so they don't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. \n\nWait, no, actually, hold on. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply them, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the constant term 20, it becomes 6*20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expressions. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the resulting terms will have combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (if any) in the second part. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check if there's a constant term in that expansion. To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) giving me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) giving me a term \\(20c^0\\), then when I multiply them together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\).

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the problem asks for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient when \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating that, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe when I multiply everything out, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which includes various terms in \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider how the second part affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the expression has \\(c\\) terms. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term where, after expanding both expressions, the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. That makes more sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, as before, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by this term, the \\(c^0\\) term would give me 6a^2b^2, and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and \\(m = 3\\) in the second part because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. I used the binomial theorem on both parts, found the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), then multiplied them together because those are the terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for the corresponding terms.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120 is correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Because \\(a^2b^2\\) means each exponent is 2. So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nLet me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nI think it doesn't, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me write out the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), the multiplication by the other expansion won't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). It will just multiply each term by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but those are separate variables. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come from one part, and the \\(c\\) terms come from the other. Since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part when calculating its coefficient. \n\nLet me double-check that. If I have two separate expansions multiplied together, the coefficients for the terms in one expansion don't depend on the other variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand both expressions separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. \n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms from the second expansion, but we can ignore those because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times some term involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but hold on, actually, no. Because when you multiply two terms, say, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 and, say, c\u00b3 from the second expansion, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b3. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2, regardless of the powers of c, then the coefficient would still be 6 because the c terms are separate. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u00b3, then you would have to multiply 6 by the coefficient of c\u00b3 in the second expansion. But since it's just a\u00b2b\u00b2, the c terms don't affect the coefficient. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both expansions. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) is for any k. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would vary depending on k. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term from the second expansion would contribute to different terms in the product. \n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving c, say, c^k, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c's power, then we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything else. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product that have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), multiplied by any power of c. \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to different terms in the product. But that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the second expansion's term that has no c's, i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, actually, if we consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the c's, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when you set c=1, so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too high. \n\nWait, but no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get different terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. Because only the constant term would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Because any other term from the second expansion would involve c's, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c's, then we have to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, if we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the c's, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. So, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c=1, so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because when you expand, you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut that seems correct, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nWe can think of this as a product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, contributing to different terms in the product. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c's, we have to consider all such contributions. \n\nWait, but no, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of c, so when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, it results in terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k, where k ranges from -6 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any c's, would only come from the term where k=0, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, we get 2k = 6, so k = 3. \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm getting 120 instead of 384. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with c, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered all terms in the second expansion. But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, regardless of the c's. So, it's only the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1) = 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 * (1) = 1 for \\(a/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of c, it's 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because I have two different answers depending on how I approach it. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms or specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific c term. \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific c term, say \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120. \n\nBut the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think means the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. \n\nWait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut in the smaller example, that logic worked. So, in our case, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify what exactly is meant by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that worked. Let me try another small example to confirm. \n\nSuppose \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). \n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1*4=4. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients, which is 2*4=8. \n\nBut if I look at the product, the term \\(a^2c^2\\) has coefficient 1, \\(a^2*2\\) has coefficient 2, \\(a^2*1/c^2\\) has coefficient 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches 1*4. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2*(1 + 2 + 1) = 8, which is correct because each term in the second expansion multiplies the 2ab term, giving 2ab*c^2, 4ab, and 2ab/c^2, so the coefficients are 2,4,2, which sum to 8. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct? \n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, or specifically looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's. \n\nIf it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, it's 120. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any c terms, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from the first and second expansions where the c terms are constant. So, it's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is 120. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, why is there a discrepancy? \n\nWait, perhaps because in the smaller example, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 4. \n\nBut in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it results in different terms, each with a different power of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 4, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut that contradicts the earlier logic where the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nI think the confusion is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c or specifically looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's. \n\nIf it's the former, then it's 384. If it's the latter, it's 120. \n\nBut the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of c, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, that worked. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, that worked. So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nHowever, earlier I thought it was 120, but that was under the assumption that we're only looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c, which would mean it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nSince the problem doesn't specify any c terms, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. \n\nBut let me check the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c's, meaning that all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the c's, would have their coefficients summed up. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm still unsure because earlier I thought it was 120. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose we consider the entire expression as a product of two independent variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of any term in the second expansion. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the coefficients don't multiply like that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. \n\nWait, let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo, the final answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. Hmm. \n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, which matches 1*2=2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, so when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it creates different terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then recognizing that this coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so n is 4. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where the power of a is 2 and the power of b is 2. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when does \\(4 - k = 2\\)? Let me solve that: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part.\n\nBut hold on, the second part is in terms of c and 1/c, while the first part is in terms of a and b. Since a and b are different variables from c, their coefficients shouldn't interfere with each other. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Because when you multiply, the a and b terms don't interact with the c terms. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving powers of c. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nHowever, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve c, which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part times the entire second expression. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant. It's another polynomial. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll have \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when you multiply, you'd have \\(6 \\times\\) each coefficient of the terms in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire second expression. But that can't be, because the second expression isn't a single term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a single term with coefficient 6. When you multiply it by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of c, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the product where the a and b parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the c part is. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c = 1. So, if I substitute c = 1 into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial and the second polynomial is in c, which doesn't interfere with a and b, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, but no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nBecause when you distribute, \\(a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\) would give you terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, you need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when c = 1, which is 64, as I found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). \n\nSo, simplifying that, the term becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k is 2. \n\nNow, for the c part, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c exponent, we need to sum over all possible m. That is, for each m from 0 to 6, we have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over m from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, because \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is part of the coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. \n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nLooking at the general term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving for \\(k\\), if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term where \\(k = 2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Now, I need to calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nI remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, how does that play into finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nI think since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the variables are separate. That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients will multiply as well. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by the second factor, it will be multiplied by terms that involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. \n\nWait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, that seems confusing. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That means that in the entire expansion, we're looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum up their coefficients. \n\nBut how does that work? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but actually, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting 1 for all variables gives you the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's like we're treating the second polynomial as a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I should consider the expansion more carefully. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients of each term are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each of these products will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. \n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient contributed to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWhich is exactly what I did before: 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's like we're multiplying the two coefficients together. \n\nSo, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\n3. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\).\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

In the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, let me calculate that coefficient. \n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that part affects the coefficient. Hmm, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is about \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term from the first expansion. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term would give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes sense now. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nOkay, so let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic is that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and since it doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can contribute to the term without \\(c\\) is by multiplying with the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be found using the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? Hmm, I think so. But I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the part of the expression that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has powers of \\(c\\).

Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that would mean that in the product of the two expansions, we're looking for terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and then the rest of the term can have any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're just looking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be multiplied by other terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), but that's not directly helpful here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then its coefficient is counted, and then we sum all those coefficients. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. That is, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The problem statement doesn't specify, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's safe to assume that we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all specified. But the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term will have some power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but that's exactly what I did before. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each time \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product, it's multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be the sum over all possible terms in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a specific example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total coefficient for each term in the first expansion. So, that supports the idea that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether this is correct. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAnswer: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, I need to see how it interacts with the second part. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated as a constant, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second part is raised to the 6th power and involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just have the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expression in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire second part. But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific term from the second expansion, but it's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me try to write it out.\n\nFirst, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). As we saw earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is an expression, not a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term from the second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but no, the problem is as given. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) since it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and I might be missing something.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\((\\text{term from first expansion}) \\times (\\text{term from second expansion})\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) or something, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that's not how coefficients work.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the answer is 6 because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it since it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it another way. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nSimplifying the second part: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the first part by the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Then, the total coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that seems more reasonable. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part), giving 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me write that out. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean that the \\(c\\) terms will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything\u2014they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), it gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the \\(c\\) terms are\u2014each multiplication will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and you multiply it by every term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to different terms in the product. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we actually don't care about the specific \\(c\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients add up. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of that power in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems like the coefficient would be 384. But let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient, but since we're not considering any specific \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 1 * (c + 1/c), but since we're not considering \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2. Wait, but in reality, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first polynomial is only up to \\(b^2\\), but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Hmm, maybe my earlier approach isn't correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the exponents. Let me go back. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example I thought of earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first polynomial, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, if I expand that, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient. \n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does this mean I can ignore the second part? Hmm, not exactly. Because when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut actually, the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both parts. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, and the coefficients will add up accordingly. \n\nBut actually, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and all those terms contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that's not quite correct either because when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the variables don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, not an entire expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, we have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a numerical coefficient. \n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I have to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, I find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? The original problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nHmm, that wording is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, then the answer is 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is structured as it is, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a bit odd because it's not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nIn algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the coefficients from the other variables multiplied together. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nI think the confusion arises from the wording. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But if it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. \n\nGiven that the problem is presented in a way that seems to expect a numerical answer, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which equals 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, for \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), the exponent on \\(a\\) is 2, and on \\(b\\) is 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). \n\nCalculating the binomial coefficient for \\(k=2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure yet how it relates to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the variables are separate. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) from the second part. \n\nBut the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, that doesn't sound right. \n\nHold on, maybe I need to think about it differently. When I multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms in the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m(1/c)^n\\), but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. \n\nSo, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, the second part can be any term because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and multiply them by the corresponding term in the first expansion. But since the first term's \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{[each term in the second expansion]}\\). So, each of these will have coefficients multiplied together. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms that have \\(c^k (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{k - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\), \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in this case, the first part doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\), but if I had \\((a + b)^4\\), as in the original problem, then when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present, but multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). \n\nSo, the question is, when it asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean adding up all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nTherefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\), it's essentially 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the question had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute the specific term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's safe to assume that it's the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, hence 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can come from multiplying any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each of these, but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As we calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nYes, that seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
