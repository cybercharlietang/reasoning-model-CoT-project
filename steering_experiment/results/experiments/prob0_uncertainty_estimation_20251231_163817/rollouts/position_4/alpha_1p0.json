    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponents are both 2, which would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). Does that mean I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nHmm, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the other part is in \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expression in \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expression in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever is in the \\(c\\) part. But that would still be a term involving \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the other part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would also be 120. But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think more likely, the problem wants the coefficient when considering the entire expression, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) part, but since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the same as 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But then 6 times 64 would be 384, which seems too high. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. \n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's assuming that \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable and the coefficient is in terms of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually numerical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(something). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but only the numerical part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is part of a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part is part of the product. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to think of it differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's probably not the case because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. \n\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion: correct, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion: correct, the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying them: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. \n\nHmm, so maybe the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that regardless of the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved. But actually, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor, and the second factor doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms in the second part. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if you have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), when you expand it, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial gets multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider it as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the coefficients. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but is that the correct interpretation? Or does the problem just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms? Because if so, then perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second part, you're scaling the entire first expansion by the second expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would still be 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because in the first expansion, the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(ab^1\\), so when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's a different case because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't go beyond their original exponents. \n\nWait, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. When multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by each of these terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nSince the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separately from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one affects the coefficients of the other. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it this way: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, since the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then see how it interacts with \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it's like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to look for a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that out. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and multiply them together? Or is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of the other part? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how these two parts interact. \n\nLet me consider that when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. However, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute other terms. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the terms in the second expansion that result in a term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, then the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion would be 6 times the coefficient of that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. \n\nWait, but that would mean the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not considering the specific terms in the second expansion. Maybe I should think differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied as a whole. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\nWait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the second factor contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense! So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part has coefficient 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That means I need to consider how multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so I think the key here is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then I multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since none of those terms affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) will just be the original coefficient multiplied by the coefficients from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be part of the resulting expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are being multiplied by terms that include \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be correct. Let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2\\), but if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), that would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm only interested in the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) term. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to a different term in the product. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be a huge number, and I don't think that's the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider the entire product as two separate parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that still has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's impossible because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero? That can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying it's a non-zero number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient for each of those would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) power, then it's the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is a multiple of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, 6, multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check that logic again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like term from P multiplied by term from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) would contribute to a different term in the product, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of c, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so substituting c = 1, we get (1 + 1)^6 = 64, which is correct. So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 => 2k = 6 => k = 3.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to consider only the terms where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), giving 120.\n\nBut earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all coefficients, but perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of c. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion includes all powers of c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because I have two different interpretations: one where I consider only the constant term in the second expansion, giving 120, and another where I consider all terms, giving 384.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying the power of c, so maybe it's indeed 384. But I need to clarify this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. So, in that case, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about it another way. If I have the product of two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) would contribute to a term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a power of c, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, it would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have P(a, b) = \\(a^2b^2\\) and Q(c) = 1 + c + c^2. Then, the product would be \\(a^2b^2(1 + c + c^2)\\), which would have terms \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1, but the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 3, so 1 * 3 = 3. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 1, so that approach doesn't hold. Wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, so in that example, P(a, b) = \\(a^2b^2\\) and Q(c) = 1 + c + c^2. The product is \\(a^2b^2 + a^2b^2c + a^2b^2c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 1, which is equal to the coefficient in P(a, b) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), which is 1. So, in that case, it's 1 * 1 = 1, not 1 * 3.\n\nSo, that suggests that the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, if I have P(a, b) = \\(a^2b^2\\) and Q(c) = 1 + c + c^2, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 1, which is equal to 1 (from P) times 1 (from Q at c^0). So, that suggests that the correct approach is to multiply the coefficients of the respective terms that result in the desired term in the product. So, in this problem, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I just need to find the specific term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nLet me write down the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well if the variables are the same, but in this case, the variables are different. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from the first part, and the second part contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, actually, the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it as a constant, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's a term that exists in the product, but if the second part is multiplied by it, then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the product. But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems possible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first factor, and the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second factor, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. That seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is just 6, because the second part is multiplied by it, but that doesn't seem right because the second part has its own terms. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering the multiplication, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6. But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem didn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the entire expansion and see. Let me try expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\) given by \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is actually 6 times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number, but in this case, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit too simplistic.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps that's not the case either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify: When you have two separate variables in the product, the coefficient of a term involving only those variables is just the product of their coefficients, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting that as the answer, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that exists in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) varies based on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) would vary depending on the term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term from the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting that as the answer, but it's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient would be 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure if that's what it's asking for.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again: It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't know if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. So, perhaps the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, each term from the first factor is multiplied by each term from the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would involve considering the multiplication. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about it differently: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which isn't standard.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at it as a two-variable problem. Let me think: The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which means that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But again, that seems complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6. Let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but none of them affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation as if the problem is asking for the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\).\n\nBut that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't just a sum of coefficients; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term from the second expansion, but that's not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6. Let me go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, the second part does not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I just need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me write that down. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that makes sense. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the other part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, maybe I need to consider all possible ways the terms can multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible products where the term from the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial is a constant term, because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which wouldn't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with the constant term from the second part. So, yes, I think that's correct. \n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by some term from the second part. But since the second part has terms with powers of \\(c\\), unless that term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the product will have \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, that means the coefficient is indeed the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. When I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), I got \\(m = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the second expansion as \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The number of terms is 7, from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\). The middle term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is the constant term, as I found. So, that's correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, the constant term is indeed the fourth term, which corresponds to \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any other term in the second expansion that could combine with a term from the first expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second expansion had a term with \\(c^1\\), and the first expansion had a term with \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), but wait, no, the first expansion doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. The first expansion is only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a constant term from the second part. \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and see if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions or multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is sufficient. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is more complicated because the second part is raised to the 6th power, but since it's separate from the first part, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with a term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, as I thought before, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and to get a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you have to multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion or at least check with a smaller exponent. Let me try with a smaller exponent to see if my method works. \n\nSuppose instead of \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\((a + b)^2\\), and instead of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). \n\nIn \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the expansion is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the constant term is 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. \n\nIf I compute the entire product: \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 2, so the coefficient is indeed 2. That matches my method. So, applying the same method to the original problem should be correct. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, just one more check. Let me compute the entire expansion for the original problem, but maybe not fully, just to see if the coefficient makes sense. \n\nThe first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nThe second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nMultiplying these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think I've arrived at the right answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I need to consider the entire product, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't matter because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're only interested in terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find all terms in the product where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out. So, in other words, when multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we multiply by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is it correct that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion? Let me think about it again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire coefficient being 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nJust to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in this expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient for a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because we're only interested in the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of c\u2070 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, the only term that doesn't involve c is c^0, which we found to have a coefficient of 20. So, yes, when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, the coefficient becomes 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

In \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients? Or do they? \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. \n\nLet me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible products. \n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right either. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense either because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, so each of those products would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the only term where \\(c^k\\) is 1 (i.e., \\(k=0\\)) would be the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the second expansion would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, since 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms because they are multiplied by different variables. So, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me try again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient in front of it, considering all possible terms from the other expansion. So, maybe the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\), then when I multiply them, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum would be multiplied by every term in the second sum. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, yes, that seems to make sense. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step again.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): Using the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\n2. Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): Substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Multiplying them: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me think. Each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. Therefore, the sum of coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach is correct, and the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider an alternative approach just to be thorough. Maybe I can think about the entire expansion as a product and see if \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, but no, because the other part is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times 64.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Let me write that out for \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate that coefficient.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the original expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms when multiplying. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) part and just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it?\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe all those multiplications just contribute a factor, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the original expression, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a separate factor and realize that when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean I need to find the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which has variables only in \\(c\\). Therefore, each of those multiplications would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as I calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. But in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term? Let me check.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. The key point is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by a term from the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, my earlier approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients was incorrect because the sum of coefficients includes terms where \\(c\\) is raised to different powers, but those terms would actually result in different variable parts when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we calculated, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me just double-check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponents cancel out, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). This occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just contribute a constant factor, and I can compute that separately.\n\nLet me try to break it down. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which doesn't change it. Alternatively, if I have other powers of \\(c\\), they would change the expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just scale it. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. Now, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), those terms could be \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), 1, \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), or \\(c^{-6}\\), depending on the expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) in it, I think the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me write that down. \n\nThe general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are multiplied by different variables. \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the variables are different (a, b, c), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, right? Because if it's not a constant term, it would bring in some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have variables other than \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, actually, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms would contribute their coefficients as well. Hmm, I'm getting confused. \n\nLet me clarify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, no. If I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would not contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the only term that affects \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second part is 1, meaning the constant term. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nLet me check that. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). If I expand both, then \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), right? Because that would make \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), and then \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. If I have two separate expansions, and I'm multiplying them, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute its own coefficient to the product's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nBut actually, I think that's incorrect. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering all terms, regardless of the other variables. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nBut let me verify this. Let's say I have \\( (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\). And the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, if I multiply each term of the first expansion by each term of the second, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAnd as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe only the constant term would contribute, but now I'm seeing that all terms contribute because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum over all products of coefficients whose variables multiply to give that term. \n\nIn this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the coefficient will be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm a bit confused because I initially thought only the constant term would contribute, but now I see that all terms contribute because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's like the coefficient is being pulled out, and the rest is summed over all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from P) times 64 (sum of coefficients in Q), which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2. So, the term \\(2ab\\) multiplied by 2 gives 4ab, which is correct. \n\nSo, applying that logic here, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion times 6. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), what's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by it. So, unless there's a term in the second expansion that affects \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which I don't think it does because the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in the second expansion that's multiplied by it. \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part? Because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding terms involving \\(c\\), but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't change. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something else would still have the same \\(a^2b^2\\) part, but with different coefficients depending on the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're introducing other variables, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which isn't part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's only considering the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just multiplied as a constant factor. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part isn't a constant; it's an expression with \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. \n\nBut the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. But I think the correct approach is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) becomes \\(2abc + 2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) becomes \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) and 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)), but since we're considering coefficients regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first expansion) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 384. \n\nBut let me confirm that. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) times the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, that sum is 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for k from 0 to 6) = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). So, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we saw earlier. Then, when multiplied by \\(Q\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\)). Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient in Q)} \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\)).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\(P\\), when multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\)). Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(6 \\times\\) coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\)).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut let me check that again. Let me denote \\(Q = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients in \\(Q\\) are the binomial coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high, but let me see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would simply be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, when multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), which is, for example, \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, 15c^{-2}\\), 6c^{-4}\\), c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their coefficients. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these, you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^2, 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-2}, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-4}, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all these terms, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that's 384. So, that matches what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, then 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Because when you have two polynomials, say \\(P(x) = p_0 + p_1x + p_2x^2 + \\dots + p_nx^n\\) and \\(Q(x) = q_0 + q_1x + q_2x^2 + \\dots + q_mx^m\\), then the coefficient of \\(x^k\\) in the product \\(P(x)Q(x)\\) is the sum over all \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) such that \\(i + j = k\\) of \\(p_i q_j\\). But in this case, \\(P\\) is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(Q\\) is in variable \\(c\\). So, the variables are separate, so when you multiply them, the terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) term.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(Q\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember that trick, I could expand \\(Q\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). So, adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7; 7 + 15 = 22; 22 + 20 = 42; 42 + 15 = 57; 57 + 6 = 63; 63 + 1 = 64. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients from all these terms, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me add those numbers step by step:\n\n- 6 (from \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\))\n- 6 + 36 = 42\n- 42 + 90 = 132\n- 132 + 120 = 252\n- 252 + 90 = 342\n- 342 + 36 = 378\n- 378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The coefficients are the binomial coefficients, and their sum (evaluated at \\(c = 1\\)) is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is in that part. \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so I guess I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, their exponents don't interfere with each other. That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Or wait, no, maybe not. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), then when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, hold on, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms will be of the form \\((\\text{terms in }a \\text{ and }b) \\times (\\text{terms in }c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because when we talk about the coefficient of a specific term in a product, we usually consider the coefficients as constants. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be 6 times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad, because the coefficient of a term usually refers to a specific term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be the case either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). That would make sense, and that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the context of the entire expression would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would give 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check both approaches.\n\nFirst approach: Summing all coefficients in the second expansion gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond approach: Looking for the specific term where \\(c^0\\) is present, which gives 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the key here is understanding what exactly is being asked. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to consider all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k=2\\), and for each such \\(k\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) such that \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is any term. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, let me verify this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe a better example: Let's say \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, which might not make sense unless we're considering specific terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I'm getting confused because the problem isn't specifying whether it's looking for the coefficient as a polynomial or a specific numerical coefficient. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\), it's likely that it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would require considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. Therefore, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, but let's think about it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the entire expression at \\(c = 1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients, not just the specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384.\n\nBut if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, as I did earlier, giving 120.\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, to be thorough, I should check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the second interpretation, because when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expressions, you usually consider the term with the same variables and exponents, which would include the necessary powers of other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to be \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because the other terms would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, if you're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're implicitly looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would multiply to give a constant term) in the second part will combine to give the overall coefficient we're looking for.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part? But that doesn't seem right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that seems too broad because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both expansions, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them, you get 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's another way to approach it, but I think this is the right method.\n\nSo, to recap, I used the binomial theorem on both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), found the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) respectively, and then multiplied them together to get the final coefficient.

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me see: in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of that part as well? Hmm, maybe. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can separate the two parts. \n\nLet me think: if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and then I multiply each term by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will involve terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the two expansions separately. \n\nThat is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), like a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part times the entire expansion of the other part. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term multiplies each term. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I would just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give me a polynomial where each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6, the coefficient from the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient equal to 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum over all the terms in the second polynomial, each multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we can have any \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times 6. So, that's 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other part. \n\nYes, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\), because you have \\(a^2 \\times c\\) and \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2 \\times (1 + 1) = 4\\), and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be \\(1 \\times (1 + 1) = 2\\). \n\nSo, in this simpler case, the coefficients are indeed multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but in the simpler case, the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial was 2, which is \\(2^1\\), and in the original problem, the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check by another method. Let's compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is the sum over all terms, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, which matches what I found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients of the second polynomial, which gives me the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems to confirm it. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, but since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these contributions. \n\nWait, but that would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. \n\nIn this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the exponent of \\(c\\) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually computing a small part of the expansion. Let's say I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6c^6a^2b^2\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36c^4a^2b^2\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90c^2a^2b^2\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 = 90a^2b^2/c^2\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 = 36a^2b^2/c^4\\),\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6 = 6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nNow, if we collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficients would be 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. Adding these up: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. \n\nYes, that adds up to 384. So, that confirms it. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only from the first part, and when I multiply it by the second part, it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with c, which are different variables, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion? That doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a polynomial in c, so when you multiply, you'd get a product of two polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't have a's or b's, so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part. But then, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in c. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering c. So maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the terms you're multiplying. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, when you expand it, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various k, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you get 6 times each of those coefficients, which would be the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without c, so how can it be multiplied by terms in c? \n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\), it's a polynomial in a and b, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in c. So when you multiply them, you get a product where each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, but without any c terms. So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is if the term from the second part is the constant term, which is 20. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term \\(20\\) which is \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of a and b are 2 each, and sum their coefficients. But in this case, since the second part is a polynomial in c, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is the constant term. So, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can have any power of c, but the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times c^k. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, then that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's the coefficient when considering all variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering c, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a larger term that includes c. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating c as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible c terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, but the problem doesn't specify k, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, let me go back. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, as I thought earlier, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut let me verify that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0 \u21d2 k = 3. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, then only the term where the second factor is 20 (the constant term) will contribute. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then we would have to consider that term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the term where the exponent of c is zero, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me think.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(n = 4\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and we don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do we need to consider the entire expression?\n\nWait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), when we multiply, each term will be of the form \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we need to sum up all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these will result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Or maybe it's considering all terms, but that wouldn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire expansion, all terms will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. For any expression \\(P(c)\\), the sum of the coefficients is \\(P(1)\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients like 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when we collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those will have coefficients 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's coefficients sum to 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of that power of \\(c\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's implying that we need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), and sum their contributions. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is the correct interpretation. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, each such term would have the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of that something with \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, including the parts with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. Wait, but that's not what the problem says. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the sum of all coefficients from these terms. That is:\n\n6 (from \\(a^2b^2c^6\\)) + 36 (from \\(a^2b^2c^4\\)) + 90 (from \\(a^2b^2c^2\\)) + 120 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) + 90 (from \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\)) + 36 (from \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\)) + 6 (from \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\)).\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That matches, so that's consistent.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the coefficients: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me add the numbers again:\n\n6 (from c^6) + 36 (c^4) = 42\n\n42 + 90 (c^2) = 132\n\n132 + 120 (constant term) = 252\n\n252 + 90 (1/c^2) = 342\n\n342 + 36 (1/c^4) = 378\n\n378 + 6 (1/c^6) = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we saw earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum, but coefficients are specific numbers, so maybe I'm not understanding correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the term is a constant term, meaning \\(c^0\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of multiple terms depending on \\(c\\). Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which would be when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but without specifying any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6, as found in the first expansion, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so each term would have a different coefficient, but the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the product term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense, so I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product involving \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I don't consider the \\(c\\) terms and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that polynomial, meaning that for each power of \\(c\\), there's a corresponding coefficient. But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nTherefore, I think the only way the problem makes sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
