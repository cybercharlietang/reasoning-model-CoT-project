    "text": " \n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me calculate the coefficient for that term. \n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be right. Let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can be part of the product is if it's multiplied by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant term. \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I find that, I can multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part, to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nAlright, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these two, it's \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me see. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. The binomial coefficients were calculated correctly, and the exponents were handled properly. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), applying the binomial theorem, it should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me calculate those coefficients. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{0}\\) is 1, so the first term is \\(a^4\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}\\) is 4, so the next term is \\(4a^3b\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that's \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}\\) is 4, so \\(4ab^3\\), and finally \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}\\) is 1, so \\(b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplying them together. But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part. So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from the first part and multiply it by every term from the second part, and then add up all those products. \n\nBut hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve the variable \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else. So, actually, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the expansion where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. \n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. When I multiply these together, I get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut just to double-check, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need the part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. So, that's why we found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiplied it by 6, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the term we found earlier. So, that's why we only need to consider the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product of the two expansions. \n\nThe first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's why we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), we would have taken the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second part. But in this case, it's \\(c^0\\), so 20, giving 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recapitulate. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem logical, and I double-checked each part. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. Next, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is considered, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is found to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together yields the final result.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That should correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

The second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be part of the product.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, it would indeed be \\(6 \\times\\) each term's coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would include all the possible combinations, which would be \\(6 \\times 64\\), as I thought. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by whatever comes from the second expansion. Since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expression, and the second expression is multiplied entirely, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, leading to 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and any term from the second expansion will be multiplied by it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so all the terms from the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making the coefficient 6 \u00d7 64. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I expand both expressions:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 \u00d7 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check if the problem is correctly interpreted. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with a coefficient that is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 2ab \u00d7 (c + 1/c), but wait, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is only in terms of \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no, in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't appear because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be zero. \n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the only terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example I thought of, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term in the product. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, leading to 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's as if we're scaling that term by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the simpler example, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the product. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and should just proceed with the initial approach. So, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the sum of its coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n3. Multiply these two results together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I only need to consider the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think about that again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the part of the expression that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only contribute to the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is a product, so technically, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product terms would be like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nHmm, so does that mean I need to sum the coefficients of all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the coefficient for each such term in the product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to add up all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to different terms in the product. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, but since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can have both positive and negative exponents, maybe \\(m\\) can be from -6 to 6? Hmm, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponents go from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2, I think. Wait, no, actually, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents are \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). So, each term has a different exponent of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from \\((a + b)^4\\), it just adds a coefficient for each of those terms.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, but let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second expression, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expression, but that doesn't seem right because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is zero. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused now. On one hand, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's specifically \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by any term, so each term in the second part would contribute to a different term in the product. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) would be a term, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) would be another, and so on, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part).\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. So, that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), m ranges from 0 to 6. So, each of these terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part, each multiplied by 6. The sum of coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120 if considering only the constant term. Let me check that again. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expression again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, I'll go with 384 as the coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that's \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the multiplication affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because if I take any other term from \\((a + b)^4\\), like \\(a^3b\\), then when I multiply it by the other expression, it would give me terms like \\(a^3b \\cdot c^6\\) or \\(a^3b \\cdot 1\\), but those wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). But none of these will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself because they all have different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (from the second expression's constant term), it remains 6. But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're not just multiplying by a constant, you're multiplying by a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will actually be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only the constant term would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as is. If you multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how you expand the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part isn't a single term. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nBut wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 384. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion. Let me think: if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the sum over all possible k of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part). Wait, no, because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 2. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of c, that's not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would be different. So, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, which one is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, I get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a number. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused. Maybe I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me try to calculate it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me first compute \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all these terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a certain term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would be the coefficient in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, for example, if I have P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + ... and Q(c) = c^6 + ... , then the product would have terms like a^2b^2c^6, etc. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because in some contexts, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you might need to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me try to think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial isn't a constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P and Q, then the coefficient of a term in P * Q is the sum of products of coefficients from P and Q whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since P is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and Q is in \\(c\\), the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the entire Q. But that can't be right because Q is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems correct. For example, if P = a^2b^2 and Q = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6, then P * Q would be a^2b^2 times each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is a^2b^2 times (c^6 + 6c^4 + ... + 1/c^6), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients in Q, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(m\\) can be any value from 0 to 6, because \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) can be any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check one more time. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. \n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient for this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that gives me the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nOkay, that takes care of the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but wait, do I need to consider the entire expansion, or can I just find the coefficient of a specific term? Hmm, since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, I think I can treat the second part as a separate expansion and then see how it affects the coefficient. \n\nWait, actually, maybe I need to consider the entire product. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that, I think the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), only the exponents of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different coefficient. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to find the total coefficient contributed by all terms in the second part. \n\nWait, no, actually, maybe not. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will contribute to a different part of the overall expression. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need to sum up all the contributions from the second part. \n\nBut hold on, actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part is a generating function for the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because I'm assuming that all coefficients from the second part contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's correct to sum all the coefficients from the second part, because each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for each of those terms will be 6 times the coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so in that case, we need to consider the entire product and sum all the coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. \n\nNow, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term from the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product is a sum over all possible combinations of terms from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which is equivalent to evaluating the second part at \\(c = 1\\), giving us the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). On the other hand, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But 384 is less than 1024, which makes sense because 384 is just one part of the total expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, when I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in the entire expansion, which is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384, which is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of all coefficients in this expansion is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product terms will have variables like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, right? Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you'd get terms with \\(c\\) in them, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nThat makes sense because if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Because any other term from the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term in the product have \\(c\\) in it, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's see. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. \n\nEarlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nSo, multiplying that by the constant term 20, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check the steps.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. Correct, and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Then, considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Used the binomial theorem to express it as a sum, found the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That's when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\n3. Then, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, so those wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second part matters here.\n\nAlternatively, if the question had asked for a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), then we would have to consider other terms from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the only contributing term is when we multiply by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can check by actually expanding both parts a bit and seeing.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm only interested in the terms where the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should have no \\(c\\) at all, right? Or does it?\n\nWait, actually, hold on. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product. When you multiply these two, the variables are separate. So, the variables in the product would be \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but the product would have terms that include \\(c\\) as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually appear multiple times with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as a product, so when you multiply the two expressions, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^lc^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is some integer depending on the expansion of the second part.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a term that exists on its own in the product\u2014it's always accompanied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is what we're looking for. Which brings us back to the earlier approach: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (which is 20). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had meant the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be a different interpretation, but I don't think that's possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, without considering \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be an expression involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think of another way. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the second part separately because when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, since I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that I'm considering the expansion of both parts multiplied together. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something else. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we're considering the entire expression, so any terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by other terms in the second part would have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of a larger term, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, because otherwise, it's multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then that would be the coefficient that, when multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part), would give me the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me find that constant term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, so only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if there's another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because if I take any other term from the first expansion, it would have a different power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the second expansion.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), any term multiplied by it would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get a sum of terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering \\(c\\), would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Wait, that can't be right.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to consider all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. But since the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems off because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would give multiple terms, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), and the coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second expansion), which gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials: the first is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient (not the entire term), we need to sum the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, and multiply by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) the product of the coefficients, which is 6 * sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to consider specific powers of \\(c\\), say \\(c^m\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) would be 6 * \\dbinom{6}{k} where \\(6 - 2k = m\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the second expansion and see if the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When c = 1, it's (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just write it out again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst expansion: \\((a + b)^4\\). Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nProduct: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " \n\nSo, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), applying the binomial theorem, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and find the coefficient when multiplied together. But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Or do I need to consider them as well? Hmm, maybe I should think about it more carefully. \n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some terms involving \\(c\\). But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that seems complicated because the second part has multiple terms. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I can just take the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, since each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But that might not be correct because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. \n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, in the original problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but just \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that we're considering the entire product and looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in reality, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, but that would still be a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the answer would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, let me proceed with that understanding. \n\nFirst, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but if we're considering the entire product, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nI think that makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical value. So, I think the answer is 120. \n\nLet me just double-check my steps. \n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and found the constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 20. \n3. Multiplied the two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem, this should expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm specifically looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nSo, if \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is the term, and I want \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nOkay, so now I have the coefficient from the first part. But the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should consider whether the second part affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are different. That is, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the product will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), will only affect the exponents of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6? \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, no, because in the product, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is just adding more variables. But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but no, because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6, and then I multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too high. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should multiply. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms from each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by each term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of those terms is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient from the first part, because you're just multiplying by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not right because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the variables are separate, so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial has multiple terms. \n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding term in the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second polynomial, which does involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is just adding more variables. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would still have the same coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second polynomial, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is incorrect because the second polynomial isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded separately. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're just multiplying it by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check this again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is just adding more variables. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficients do multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and similarly for other powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should multiply. So, perhaps the correct answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Let me expand both parts separately and see how the terms combine. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms would be \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2(1/c^2)\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 20 times 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems to contradict my earlier thought where I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But actually, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. \n\nBut no, that's not correct because each term in the second part is a term in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. \n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. \n\nIn this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms are in \\(c\\), so they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. \n\nTherefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only determined by the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, I think I was overcomplicating it earlier. The answer should be 6. \n\nWait, but let me check again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent? If so, then the coefficient would be the sum of all the products of 6 and each coefficient in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was just 6. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. \n\nWait, but the expression is a product, so the coefficients do multiply. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial isn't a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not 100% confident. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but that's because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. \n\nWait, but in my original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is just adding more variables. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the second part doesn't contribute to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in the original problem, the first part does have \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you multiply by the second part, which is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but in my example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 2, which is the coefficient from the first part. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, not 2, because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the second part. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but in my example, the coefficient was zero, not 2, because the second part didn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nBut that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. \n\nIn this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term that is \\(1\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but that's not possible because the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that is 1 in terms of \\(c\\), which is the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nIn the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be combined with the constant term in the second polynomial to form a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second polynomial would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Let me confirm this with my earlier example. \n\nIn my example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 2, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 1 (since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) has a constant term of 0, but wait, no, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which matches my earlier observation. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., the constant term), because multiplying by this term will not change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in the coefficients of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as I found earlier, which is 6. But since this is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or anything like that. So, does that mean I just need the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it? That seems confusing.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would then be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion would contribute to a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by every term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each of those terms would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, there are no terms in the product that have just \\(a^2b^2\\) because every term from the second expansion brings along a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be combined with any term from the second expansion to produce a term without \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misapplying the concept. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm considering the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's essentially the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion has multiple terms, each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, no, that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because none of the terms in the product have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me try to approach this differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single number; it's a sum of terms. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I'm considering all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to look at it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is a separate expansion, the 6 is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it because we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems contradictory because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); all terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) also have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no such term without \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, so it must have a non-zero answer. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these coefficients, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all these contributions. So, the coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of the coefficients from the second part (2). So, applying this logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) would be 1*1 = 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1*1 = 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 0 because there's no such term. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2, as I thought earlier. So, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's the former, 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense too. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now. How do I know which interpretation is correct? Let me think about how these problems are usually phrased. Typically, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term without mentioning other variables, they might be considering the term in the entire product, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. However, if they had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. Since they didn't specify, I think it's more likely that they want 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, they're considering the term with those variables and the other variables raised to zero. So, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, which would be 384. I'm not sure, but perhaps I should proceed with both interpretations and see which one makes more sense.\n\nWait, let me try to compute both and see which one is more plausible. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times 64 = 384. If I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think about the structure of the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to expand this, the terms would involve various powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) also has a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero because there's no such term without \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term from the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero. So, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be zero because there's no term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is zero.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because I thought earlier that it's 384 or 120. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this gives \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a constant; it's a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which means that the coefficient is not a constant but depends on \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) as a constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\)), then it's zero because there's no such term. \n\nWait, but in reality, the term \\(a c\\) has a coefficient of 1, and the term \\(a/c\\) has a coefficient of 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant but rather depends on \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) as a standalone term without any \\(c\\), it's zero. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is zero because every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense now. So, I think the answer is zero.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is zero because every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), resulting in no standalone \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\n\\boxed{0}"

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I just found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, but I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in the second part? Or maybe I need to consider the entire expansion?\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients is in the second part?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, right? So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first expansion's terms, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the \\(c\\) part can be any term, but we have to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(P\\), and since \\(Q\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(Q\\) is multiplied as a whole, not term by term. Wait, no, actually, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(Q = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by the term \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right, but let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6, and since \\(Q\\) is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would accumulate all the coefficients from \\(Q\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(P\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would need to cancel out to give a constant term, but no, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of its coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Suppose instead of 6, the exponent on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\) was 1. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The sum of coefficients would be 2. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12. But if I actually expand \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c + 1/c), which is 6c + 6/c. That's a polynomial, not a constant. So, the coefficient isn't a constant but depends on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that would require knowing the specific term, which isn't possible unless we consider a specific power of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, it's just 6, because the other part is multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but that's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. If I consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, if I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still not sure. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and use the concept of coefficients. \n\nWait, another approach: since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one affects the terms in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that. The term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe that's not what's being asked. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so I'm confused. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would involve the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, when I considered the term \\(c^0\\), I got 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, then that's the answer. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which would involve the other part. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nI'm going in circles here. Let me try to find a definitive approach. \n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since that's a polynomial, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve terms with \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm not confident. Let me try to think of it differently. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that's only when \\(c = 1\\). The problem didn't specify any particular value for \\(c\\), so I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nI think I need to look for a different approach. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, when I considered the term \\(c^0\\), I got 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the answer is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's a standard approach to this. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. \n\nIn this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\). The exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. The exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that's not possible because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nTherefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, then that's the answer. \n\nI think I've gone through all possible interpretations, and the most plausible one is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that when I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I consider the term \\(c^0\\), which is 20, then 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nI think I've spent enough time on this. I'll go with the answer being 6, because the other part is multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\((c + 1/c)\\), not 1. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial. So, the answer is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate expansion. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the coefficient is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 384. \n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the term \\(c^0\\), I got 120, which is different. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. \n\nI think I'll have to go with the answer being 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 6. \n\nWait, let me try to think of it as the product of two independent variables. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is just multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nI think I have to conclude that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not confident. I think I'll go with 6 as the coefficient because the other part is just multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should check with a smaller exponent. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). \n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, then that's the answer. \n\nI think I've spent too much time on this, and I have to make a decision. I'll go with the answer being 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I'll say 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not confident. I think I'll settle for 6 as the coefficient because the other part is just multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut I'm still unsure. I think I'll go with 6. \n\nWait, no, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here. So, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this affects the coefficient. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the terms from the first part. But wait, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, I might not need to expand the second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on \\(c\\), so maybe I just need to consider how the second part contributes a constant factor, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), it will become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which isn't the term I'm interested in. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, meaning the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) must cancel each other out.\n\nLet me think about how to find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be constant, the exponent must be zero. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now I have the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient from the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the constant term (the one without \\(c\\)), I need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product of the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if we multiply it by any other term, like \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), we'd end up with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which has a coefficient of 20. Multiply these two coefficients together because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term, giving a total coefficient of 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound. Each part is handled separately, and then combined since they're multiplied together. So, yeah, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, the total coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me see, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need the constant term from the second expansion, right? Because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would make the overall term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we have 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have 20. Therefore, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, that seems right. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two expansions and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) (i.e., the constant term) will just contribute a scalar multiple to the coefficient. So, that scalar is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand everything, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and each term from the second expansion would multiply this by some coefficient. But since we only want the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which is 20, the total coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), which gives:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need the constant term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying the coefficient from the first expansion (6) by the constant term from the second expansion (20), we get:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term I need. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to expand this using the binomial theorem. So, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that a bit. \n\nSimplifying the exponents, we have \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) because \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\). So, combining the exponents, it becomes \\(c^{6 - m - m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing because the second part involves \\(c\\) and the first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Wait, no, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, I think the coefficient remains the same as in the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it won't introduce any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nOh, I see! So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, let me work on that.\n\nFirst, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I started earlier, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for that term. \n\nThe binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), so plugging in the numbers, that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\).

That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, provided that the other terms don't interfere. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand this correctly. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term.

But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not possible because the product will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Let me check my reasoning again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply out the entire expression, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, and the rest of the variables are whatever they are in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would imply that the coefficient is 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. \n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should first expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should recognize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together, the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, \\(2ab\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and \\(b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). \n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the product, the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\) are both 1, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. \n\nSimilarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 (from \\(2ab\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2, so 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct because the terms are \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so together they contribute 4ab. \n\nSo, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, yes, that part is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the variables are independent, the coefficients just multiply. So, 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 64 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will do. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Alternatively, I can expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and sum the coefficients, but that's time-consuming. But I know that the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is valid. In other words, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that involves only some variables is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nIn this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second polynomial can be paired with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial, and each such pairing contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384 is the correct coefficient. \n\nI think I've thought this through enough. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), applying the binomial theorem, it would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me compute those coefficients. \n\nThe coefficients are calculated as \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nHmm, so does that mean I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me think. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how it interacts with the other part. \n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term will just be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it will become something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I only need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part. \n\nSo, my next step is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by this constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 as the constant term. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. That seems right. \n\nI think I got it. So, the answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's start with the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). That makes me think that the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by it. So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps it just gets multiplied as a constant.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part won't be affected by the second part except for being multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it means that the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the second expression is being raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part, which involves \\(c\\), doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not possible because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Maybe I need to consider that the second part is a separate expansion and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nSo, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6, but since the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but specifically, if we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
