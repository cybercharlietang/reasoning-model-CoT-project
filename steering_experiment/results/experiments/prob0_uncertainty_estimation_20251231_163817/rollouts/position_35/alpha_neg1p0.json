So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. The first part gave me 6, and the second part gave me 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think that's correct. Another way to think about it is that when you expand the entire expression, you're looking for all possible ways to choose terms from each polynomial such that when multiplied together, you get \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first and the constant term from the second. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe expand both parts a bit more. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that confirms it.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.
