    "text": " But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) part, but actually, the coefficient will be multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's an important point. So, actually, when we expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the term where in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to clarify, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the overall coefficient would be the product of these two coefficients. So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that would be correct. So, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like multiplying by a constant with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we need to collect all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something in \\(c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(Q\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times Q\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). But that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(Q\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like scaling it by that coefficient. But that seems a bit off because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes many terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve terms from both expansions. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thus contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(c\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest of the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a multiplier, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product,\" which would involve all possible combinations. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. And as I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by another method. Let me consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term would then be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by the appropriate power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). We know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions with variables. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would actually be zero unless we're considering the entire product. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I'm correct, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that accurate? Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each possible power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, if the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) part, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense, perhaps. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me approach it that way. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), because for each \\(k\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible unless we're considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem actually wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That makes more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that seems more plausible. Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they might be expecting a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all variables, but that doesn't quite make sense either. Wait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I'm not sure if that's what's intended. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering the product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is what I think the problem is asking for. So, let's proceed with that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me check that again.

When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that logic because sometimes when variables are involved, substituting 1 might not capture the correct behavior, especially if there are negative terms or if variables are in denominators. But in this case, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only from the first polynomial, the second polynomial's terms are in \\(c\\), so they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because if I take any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it would have some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term in the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Wait, no, I think that's correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial that combine to form that term. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.

    "text": " But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, is that possible? Or maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps we need to consider the entire expression, but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a single polynomial, but that would require multiplying by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which might complicate things. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the product would be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m (1/c)^{6 - m})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that correspond to the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because each term in the product would have a specific power of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so it would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by 20, giving 120. Wait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients being 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\), which would give the sum of all coefficients, but that's not what we need here. We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts the previous reasoning where I thought it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say P(a, b) * Q(c), the coefficient of a specific term in P, say a^2b^2, is just the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c). But if you're looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of the power of c, then it's indeed the coefficient in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. But in this problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, without specifying any power of c, so that would imply that it's the sum over all terms where the exponent of c is anything, but the a and b exponents are 2 each. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the product will have terms like a^2b^2c^k for various k. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the power of c, then it's the sum of all coefficients where a^2b^2 is multiplied by any power of c. But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 times c^0, i.e., the constant term in c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any power of c, so I'm not sure. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning c. So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in a, b, and c, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the c expansion, so each term would have a different power of c, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of c would be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the c expansion. Wait, but that's not how polynomial coefficients work. In a polynomial, each term has specific variables and exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is a separate term from \\(a^2b^2c^{k+1}\\), so they are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating c as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes more sense because each term in the product would have specific exponents for a, b, and c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c is just the product of the coefficients from each polynomial where the exponents of a, b, and c match. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term (where the exponent of c is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect it? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we just take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not involving \\(c\\). So, let me proceed with that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two results together to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these together, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to do that, I can consider the product as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Which is exactly what I did earlier: 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result will have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expansion would include terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but since we're looking for a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), perhaps we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that results in \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. So, first, I found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Maybe by considering the entire expansion and seeing if I can find any other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\).

We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, maybe I need to find the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nLet me check that approach. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Let me confirm that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) of 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and instead thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, that would be incorrect because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, by finding the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiplying by 6, I get 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a constant term. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. For example, is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by other terms in the second expansion, and those would contribute to the coefficient? But no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that's only if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), making the overall coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think I've arrived at the correct answer: 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, so maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit off because the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms multiplied by the 6 we found earlier. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and when you multiply by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, you'd end up with \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, each term in it is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the variables are separate: one part is \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other is \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the term itself, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that polynomial. But if we're just looking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both, so the coefficient would be multiplied by the entire expansion. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the key steps are: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. 2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. 3. The sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. 4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire second expression.

But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(k\\) is 2 for \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Wait, but no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply those two coefficients together. Let me check that approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when I expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, right? Because if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term with a non-zero exponent of \\(c\\) would not be \\(a^2b^2\\); it would have some power of \\(c\\) as well. So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because that's the only term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by that constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I'm saying that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Is that correct? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^2\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my reasoning. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expression and consider how the terms combine. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), any term from it will only affect the powers of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part's expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, that's why I only need to multiply by the constant term's coefficient. So, yes, my initial approach was correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct.
