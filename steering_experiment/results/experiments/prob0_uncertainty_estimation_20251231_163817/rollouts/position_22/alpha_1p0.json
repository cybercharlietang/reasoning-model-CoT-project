    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right either. Let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the product is of two expressions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second, resulting in terms that are products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can think of it as, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because then \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Let me check that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but I should double-check. Let me write out the expansion more carefully. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by all the terms in the second, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so when we multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). The other terms would have \\(c\\) powers, so they would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., which are different terms. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 (from the first expansion) times 20 (from the constant term in the second expansion), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first, and you multiply by every term in the second, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (20), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) component, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, which is not what we want. So, yes, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right.

So, that means I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what the exponent of \\(c\\) is. But wait, that can't be right because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the \\(a + b\\) part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but the second part isn't a single term; it's an expansion. So, when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is a separate factor, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero? Wait, that can't be right because the second part is entirely in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part (64), giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that for each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum their coefficients. So, in that case, it's indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, perhaps the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just gets multiplied as a scalar factor.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.

So, perhaps the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that. So, if I first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, let's work that out. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or is it asking for the coefficient when considering all variables? Because if it's the former, then 120 is correct. But if it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then 120 is correct as well. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, in that case, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, and the \\(c\\) terms are such that their exponents cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a different term in the product. So, since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.

Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only if the variables match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables don't interfere. So, yeah, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient becomes the product of 6 and the sum of coefficients in the second expression. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a scalar, the \\(c\\) terms would only affect if there's a term with \\(c^0\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you multiply by a polynomial, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the variables are independent, so any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or similar. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just make sure by considering a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) times (1 + 1) because when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficients sum to 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are indeed multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

    "text": " Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that would mean that when we expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a \\(c\\) in it, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the other part. So, let's tackle the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if the second part had a term with \\(c^0\\), but when multiplied by some other term, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be safe. For the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's 6, correct. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20, correct. Multiplying them together gives 120, so yes, that seems right.

Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by identifying the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20.

But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would involve \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part would contribute a scalar multiple. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that seems possible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, let me check that logic. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{another thing}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will accumulate all those coefficients from the second part. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term is \\(c^k\\) times its coefficient. So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expression times 6. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to make sure. Maybe I can consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as we found, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the terms involving \\(c\\) could affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, maybe some terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) in a way that changes the coefficient? No, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term is a power of \\(c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64. To find the sum of coefficients, we substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part. But that's only true if the two parts are independent, which they are. So, the coefficient in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so its \"coefficient\" for terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 1. Wait, no, that's not right. The second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial where the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term from the first polynomial \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Let me expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the term with \\(a\\) is \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable, not a constant. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier approach. Hmm, so maybe my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but that's a variable, not a constant. But in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not a term that includes variables. Wait, but in the problem, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when we expand it, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, but it will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable and considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not what I thought earlier. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which would be 64, as we calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable. But in the problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unusual. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as 1, which would give 6 * 64 = 384. That seems more likely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(k=2\\), so it's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's expecting just the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be considered as a constant, treating \\(c\\) as 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then see what happens when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the entire product would have terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As established earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanding, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when you expand the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part would just be a multiplier. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to give a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. Hmm, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. Let me assume that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would still be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient would indeed be the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. Let me check that again. If I take \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms}\\), then the product would have a term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be, because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what's the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find the sum of the coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression will give us the sum of the coefficients. So, let's calculate \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. The sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so when you multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other expansion).

    "text": " So, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients for specific terms in one part don't affect the coefficients in another part unless the variables are the same. Wait, in this case, the variables are different. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are in terms of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient we're looking for is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part's coefficients are being multiplied by it. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let's consider \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) will appear for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. And since the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\), that gives 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second part, when expanded, has 64 as the sum of its coefficients. So, when you multiply, each coefficient in the first part is multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, that also gives 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is: when you have two independent variables, the coefficients for terms in one variable are independent of the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it's effectively \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from 384. Now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me think again. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving a coefficient of 6. Now, for the \\(c\\) part, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by this 6, so the overall term will be \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients. So, that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the second approach, where I looked for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), I got 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the other approach, where I looked for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), that would give me the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if we set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. But if we look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 0 because there's no such term. So, in that case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any condition on \\(c\\), so it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\", so it's possible that it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in the problem statement, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. So, in this case, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be zero. Alternatively, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's also zero because there's no such term.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the product is \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which aligns with the fact that the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, in that example, the first part is \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each of those terms is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product has terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. So, in that case, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the first part doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in the original problem, the first part does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But I think that's incorrect because the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because in the problem statement, the variables are separate, so maybe the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding more terms. Wait, no, because the variables are different, so the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. The \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part can be expanded, and each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients don't interfere. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me try to compute it another way. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), this sum is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of another approach where I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiplied by 6 to get 120. But that approach would be correct only if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is not the case here. Since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we can treat the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-express the problem: we have a product of two expressions, each expanded, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in their product. So, in the product, each term from the first expansion (which is \\((a + b)^4\\)) will multiply each term from the second expansion (which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider all possible contributions to that term from each factor. Wait, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first factor and multiplying it by every term from the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering all terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, each term is scaled by 6. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently.

But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient is a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(k\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if you set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, if we multiply that by 6, we get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would have the same coefficients as \\((a + b)^4\\) scaled by 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \\times 64 = 384. So, that seems plausible. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, but \\(c\\) is another variable, so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve terms with \\(c\\) as well. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it would become terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply \\(k=0\\), meaning the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense now. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, would give the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in the second expansion would contribute a coefficient, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right either because the terms in the second expansion have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion would contribute a different power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that's what I thought before. So, if the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, where the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being 6, and since the second polynomial is being multiplied, it's like 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all \\(c^k\\) terms, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial would affect the coefficient when multiplied. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have \\( (6a^2b^2) \\times (d + e + f + ...) \\), where \\(d, e, f, ...\\) are terms from the second polynomial, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second polynomial could have terms that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's just the coefficient of that term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, I get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then I would set \\(c = 1\\), so the coefficient would be \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients, we set \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. So, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion. Wait, no, perhaps the second expansion is independent, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the result is the product of their coefficients. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) can be found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term's coefficient just the coefficient itself. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first factor, and the terms involving \\(c\\) come from the second factor. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first factor and any term from the second factor. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the entire second factor evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), because that's how polynomial multiplication works. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Let me denote the first polynomial as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you multiply them, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire expression, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, its coefficient is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me try a smaller example to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial, which is 1, times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, so sum is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b / c\\). The terms involving \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a / c\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), which is a polynomial, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) times something, then the coefficient would indeed be the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial times 1, which is 2. So, that seems to check out. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right?

But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are typically constants, not polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, that can't be. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm confused. Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients, considering the \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, as that's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's unusual because typically, when asked for a coefficient, you're looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. If the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any consideration for \\(c\\), then it's ambiguous because the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then 120 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would be incorrect because the coefficient of a term in a polynomial is the sum of the coefficients when multiplied by that term. Wait, no, actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in one multiplies each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the products of coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each. But since \\((a + b)^4\\) only has one term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the other part is the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, as I thought earlier. So, going back, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the entire expression, which would include terms with \\(c\\). But since the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many problems like this, when multiple variables are present, and a coefficient is asked for a specific combination of some variables, it's often implied that the other variables are set to a certain power, usually zero, or that we're considering the term independent of those variables. So, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).
