    "text": " Hmm, wait, 6! is 720, yes, and 3! is 6, so 6 * 6 is 36, and 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, that's correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the expression. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"
