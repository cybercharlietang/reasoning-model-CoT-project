Is there any possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, if we take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by \\(c^{-1}\\), you still have \\(a^3b \\times c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\).

When you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables would be \\(a^2b^2 * c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Hmm, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent binomial expansions, and since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, then the coefficient is just the product of the respective coefficients from each expansion. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because only then will the product result in a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). If we took any term with \\(c^m\\) where \\(m \\neq 0\\), then the product would have a \\(c^m\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we only need to consider the \\(c^0\\) term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6 choose 3 is 20, right? Because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. And 4 choose 2 is 6, that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 is 120.

So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^k\\) and another term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that affect the coefficient? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the second polynomial that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first polynomial and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second polynomial combine to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), only \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible terms. For example, could there be a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that, when multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Well, since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only has terms with powers of \\(c\\), any term from it would either add a positive or negative power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yes, only the constant term contributes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second polynomial contributes a \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can add up if there are multiple ways to get the same term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, there's only one term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if there's any other term that could contribute. For example, suppose I have a term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term \\(c^m\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, when multiplied together, the term would be \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\). We want the term where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(m = 0\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is also known. When you multiply these two generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each generating function for their respective terms. So, that would again be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, there might be interactions, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficients multiply directly.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can compute the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems tedious, but perhaps I can outline it. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Expanding each part:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part of the expression. \n\n1.

But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, the coefficient remains 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a constant term in \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120 seems right. Let me check my reasoning again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that might be more complicated. Let me see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).

So, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), that implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Since these two are independent, their coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second polynomial could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first polynomial? For example, if I take a term with \\(c\\) from the second polynomial and multiply it by a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first, would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. The \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, any term in the second polynomial that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. Therefore, those terms wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is specifically the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, I think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. But just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times 1/c + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, only the term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. So, that gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), as before.

When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, that's where \\(m = 3\\), so the term is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again: is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial.

So, the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as calculated. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, but that would be more complicated. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the constant term is only present in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), their product gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should write out the expansions a bit more. Let me see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that confirms it. I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion as a product and see if that changes anything. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but only the term that has \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) exponents, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's again 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's solid.\n\nWait, but just to be extra sure, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). We're interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, so \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. Therefore, I can be confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible contributions. For instance, could there be a term in \\(Q\\) that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) gives a term without \\(c\\)? Well, no, because \\(Q\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in \\(Q\\). So, yes, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if any other terms could contribute, but I don't think so. Because any other term in \\(Q\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, only the constant term in \\(Q\\) contributes. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the binomial coefficients from each expansion. So, since in the first part, we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and in the second part, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), their product is the coefficient we're looking for. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but do the exponents add? Wait, no, in this case, we're dealing with different variables, so the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. So, when we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the exponent of \\(c\\), so we just take the coefficient from the first polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, it would be \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a product where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But only the term with \\(c^0\\) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about if there's any other way this could be approached. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, but in this case, since we're dealing with two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the binomial theorem approach seems sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and then look for the specific term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these, you get 6 * 20 * a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possible terms. For example, is there a possibility that another term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a different term from \\((a + b)^4\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is specific to the term where \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, there's no overlap or other contributions.\n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try plugging in some numbers. Let's say \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\). Then, the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 2^4 * 2^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). Now, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(1^2 * 1^2 = 1\\), and the coefficient would be 120, as we found. So, 120 * 1 = 120. But wait, the total expression evaluated at \\(a=1, b=1, c=1\\) is 1024, which includes all terms. So, if I sum up all the coefficients, it should equal 1024. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 120, that seems plausible because 120 is much smaller than 1024, so it's just one part of the total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the constant term in the second is 20, so their product is 120. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider if the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, and its coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAnother way: Let me compute the product step by step. First, compute \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which gives \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. The only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get 120a^2b^2. All other products would involve \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about if there's any other term that could contribute. For example, could \\(a^2b^2\\) be multiplied by a \\(c\\) term and still somehow result in a term without \\(c\\)? No, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, \\(a^2b^2c\\) would still have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't what we're looking for. Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute both expansions in more detail.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(a^4\\): 1\n- \\(a^3b\\): 4\n- \\(a^2b^2\\): 6\n- \\(ab^3\\): 4\n- \\(b^4\\): 1\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n- The expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): 1\n- \\(c^4\\): 6\n- \\(c^2\\): 15\n- \\(c^0\\): 20\n- \\(c^{-2}\\): 15\n- \\(c^{-4}\\): 6\n- \\(c^{-6}\\): 1\n\nNow, when you multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. The only term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term 20. Therefore, the product of 6 and 20 is 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply when looking for the product term. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial with coefficient 6 and the constant term is 20 in the second, their product is 120.\n\nI think I've considered all angles here. I've checked the binomial coefficients, written out the expansions, considered the contributions from each part, and even thought about plugging in specific values to verify. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the terms themselves also multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) from the other expansion is \\(20\\). So, when you multiply these, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in finding the coefficients. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is at \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's also correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms? But I think the approach I took is correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients. So, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
