So, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. Is that correct? Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think that's correct. Also, checking the calculations: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. Multiplying them gives 120, so that seems right.
