When we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20. Since these two coefficients are multiplied together in the product expression, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (ignoring the \\(c\\) terms) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only combine with the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. If it combined with any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not purely \\(a^2b^2\\).
