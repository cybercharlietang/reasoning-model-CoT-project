First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial with the constant term in the second polynomial, which makes sense because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor. So, I correctly identified that I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Using the binomial theorem, I found that the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leads to \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here.

Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. In this case, the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. That means you have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for. So, yes, I think my reasoning is correct. The coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(m=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- For \\(m=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(m=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(m=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- For \\(m=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(m=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(m=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
