    "text": " So, when we multiply these two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, that's why we take the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, we just need the product of the coefficients from each respective expansion. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is definitely 120.

Actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product comes only from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a term with \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), we have to take the term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion, but that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and in the second part, since it's multiplied by any term, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 is correct.

Let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found.\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20.\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the 20 term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20, but wait, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is already multiplied by 6. So, actually, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but no, that's not quite right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we only want the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, it's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nThe first expansion: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThe second expansion: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\) will contribute to a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's the 20 term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the product is 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me also think about another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the binomial approach is sufficient here.\n\nWait, another thought: since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in considering the multiplication. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is \\(20\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(20\\), you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " So, when you multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, but scaled by the coefficients. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20, which is 120. That seems correct. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the constant term? No, because each term in the expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the only time the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives exactly one term with coefficient 20. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the part of the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the product have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and from the second part, we need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yep, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), since the \\(c^0\\) is just 1. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now.
