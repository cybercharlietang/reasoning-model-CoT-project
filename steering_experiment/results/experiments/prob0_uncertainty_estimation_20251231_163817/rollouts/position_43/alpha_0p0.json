Since these are independent, their coefficients multiply. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Wait, another thought: could there be any other terms in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term without \\(c\\)? For example, if I took a term with \\(c^1\\) and multiplied it by a term with \\(1/c^1\\), that would give \\(c^0\\). But in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so when you multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial.

    "text": " So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me think again: when expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I missed anything. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yep, that checks out. I think I'm confident now that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. We're looking for a specific term in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, we only need to consider the parts of each expansion that contribute to that term. The first part gives us the coefficient 6, and the second part gives us 20 when we consider the constant term. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient of 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct, and the logic about only needing the constant term from the second part seems right because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).
