    "text": " So, when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), unless the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, the product will have terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial will contribute to a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. So, yes, I think that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and see how the coefficients combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, for instance, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(20a^2b^2\\), which comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) with the constant term 20 from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is 6a^2b^2, and the constant term in the second is 20, so when multiplied, it's 6*20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider that when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you can treat the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables, but since they don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, that seems to align with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6 choose 3 is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd 4 choose 2 is 6, which is correct as well.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).
