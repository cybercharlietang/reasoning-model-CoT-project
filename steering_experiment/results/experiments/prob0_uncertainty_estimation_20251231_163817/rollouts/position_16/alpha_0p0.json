    "text": " That means I might not need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), unless the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something from that expansion. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But in this case, since the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, it's actually multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not just numerical coefficients; they also have variables attached. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do we find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively summing all the coefficients, which gives 64. So, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. But wait, is that the correct approach? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to sum all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which we found to be 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second part will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we sum all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. And since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it mean that I have to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the other variables? Hmm, let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part would just add a factor involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each term is a constant. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only come from the product when the second part is multiplied by 1, but that's not possible because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term. Wait, let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\) where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, possible exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, there is a term where the exponent is 0, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (which is 20) in the second part. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are independent. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I need to consider any other terms because any other term from the second expansion would involve a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The term \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, does that mean I can ignore the part involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe, but let me think again. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then perhaps the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Let me see. So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion would be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then perhaps the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms has \\(c\\) to some power. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a product of two expressions. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. Now, when I multiply this by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all these coefficients, because each term contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? That can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it was written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be the case. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but that approach would be correct if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if you think of the entire expression as a product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all terms where \\(k = 2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the problem. The problem is written as: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller exponent to see if that makes sense. Suppose the problem was \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of coefficients, which would be 2 (since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) has coefficients 1 and 1). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, the term \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 2. So, in that case, the approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? Let me check again. When I set \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, I get 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I was looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's written, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second part, because each term in the second part is a separate term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me test this with a smaller example to see if that makes sense.\n\nSuppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). If I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to support the approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, the variables are separate, so when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is it? Let me clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the scalar multiplied by that term, regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), so it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the answer would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would have a coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by a coefficient from the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think of it as a product of polynomials. The first polynomial is \\( (a + b)^4 \\), and the second is \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\). When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, and so on. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me calculate that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 384.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have terms involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Hmm, but that's complicating it. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that the answer is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms with \\(c\\) as well. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems plausible. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, because the other part is multiplied by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be a single product, but I need to consider cross terms. Wait, no, let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms where each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer would be 384. But let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, let's see. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so that's different from 384. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would have exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6*20=120. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Since it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply by all terms in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, the coefficient would be 120. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, giving the coefficient 6. Then, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the two expressions are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply a term by a polynomial, the coefficient of the term in the product is the coefficient of the term in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify that you need to consider terms where other variables are at specific exponents. But in this case, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), which would be 384. So, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those terms would have a coefficient, and all those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but actually, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Hmm, actually, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not all being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the sum of its coefficients would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would involve both parts. Let me check the problem statement again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require a different approach. Let me consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. That would mean that in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me calculate that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's the first case, where we sum over all powers of \\(c\\), giving 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you might consider the term with specific exponents for all variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the problem is indeed asking for the sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then when you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the correct interpretation is that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). What's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product? Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at c=1 is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Alternatively, if I expand the product, it's \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients, which is 2. So, that seems to confirm that when you're looking for the coefficient of a term in one variable, regardless of the others, you multiply by the sum of coefficients in the other parts.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the variables are separate, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the rest is multiplied by it, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a number is if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which gives us 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by the corresponding power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me check again. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) exponent, so maybe it's indeed asking for the sum over all \\(c\\) exponents, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would give a coefficient that's a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient a number.\n\nSo, let's try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nWe've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps I'm wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the variables are separate. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that can't be right because the problem includes the second part in the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the user is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to recognize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's not specifying any \\(c\\) term, which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but in the absence of that, I think the correct interpretation is that we're to sum over all \\(c\\) exponents, giving 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me calculate both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 * sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nCase 2: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut given that the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, I think the first case is intended. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, but that can't be right because the second part is part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the user is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that they're considering \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a number is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\)\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\): \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that might be the case, but I was confused because I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But upon expanding, it's clear that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check:\n\nSum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nCoefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, we multiply 6 by 64:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), maybe the value of \\(c\\) doesn't matter here? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the constant term in the other expansion, right? Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, it would affect the exponent, but the coefficient would still be multiplied by the term from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no, that's not right because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product, so perhaps it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in the other expansion, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the other expansion. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), each with a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But wait, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes to a different term in the product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then it's the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let me expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials multiplied together. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, again, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but that's only true if the two parts are independent, which they are. So, since the first part has a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, if there's a \\(c\\) term, it would introduce other variables, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's it.

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when finding the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial multiplies each term in the other. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, you're creating terms that are products of terms from each part. But \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just have an extra factor involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), I think. Wait, no, actually, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the product, would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the \\(c\\) terms would be separate. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6 times something. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the terms being multiplied. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) and \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\), then the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) of \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, for each such term, the coefficient is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, which is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\( \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} \\times c^{6 - 2m} \\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all variables together, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would imply that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as separate, but that would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would involve the product of the coefficients from both expansions. Wait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term's coefficient adds up. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems too simple, and the presence of the \\(c\\) terms in the expression suggests that the problem is more involved. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{2m - 6}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Now, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, step by step: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. The other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). 3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no. Let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how the second part contributes to that term. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) terms. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expansion. But wait, actually, that's not the case. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's actually just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're looking for all the terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (\\(a + b)^4\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient to the product's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not the case because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for that term. Wait, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But actually, no, because the second expansion doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product is \\(A * B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A * B\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the product's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(B\\), but that doesn't make sense because we're considering the product. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the entire \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains the same as in \\(A\\), multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Let me double-check. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can only take the term that doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   The constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the other parts involving \\(c\\) don't matter. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that's just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is an expression in terms of \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The terms from the first expansion are in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms from the second are in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expression, and the second expression contributes a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this approach. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when taking the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is just a constant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. And since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, the final coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I have to? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect the product. But wait, the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, and the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part. So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride, and their coefficients will multiply the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the second expansion will have a coefficient, and the entire 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 will be multiplied by each of those terms. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means that any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., the constant term) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by, say, 15 (the constant term from the second expansion), I'll get 90a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient would be 90. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, I might have thought that the coefficient is just 6, but that's not the case because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so the coefficients multiply when terms are combined. Therefore, I have to consider the constant term from the second expansion as well. So, yeah, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is found when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, no, that would be if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, then multiply it by 6. So, let's try that approach. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That makes more sense. So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression also involves \\(c\\), it's possible that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but unless specified, we might just be looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all those coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct only if we are considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Now, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The problem states: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would make the answer 120. Let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think it's the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me try to think of it another way. If I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), it would be 120. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's 384. Let me confirm this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, so 1 \u00d7 2 = 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, because it's \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct. But in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\), but in the smaller example, it's 2, which is the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. However, I'm going to check another source or think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me see if the problem mentions anything about \\(c\\). It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, it worked out correctly when considering the sum of coefficients. So, I think I should stick with that approach.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm second-guessing because I might have misapplied the concept. Let me think again. Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m}c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each term in the second expansion, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might just contribute a factor that's multiplied by the coefficient we found. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or has \\(c^0\\) would just contribute a scalar multiple to the coefficient. But wait, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when the exponent is even. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. Wait, but does that make sense? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, but only the constant term from the second part would result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me check my work again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Wait, but maybe I should consider the entire expansion more carefully. Let me write out the expansions in more detail to confirm. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as follows: The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's the constant term. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^4\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), \\(a^4c^2\\), \\(a^4\\), \\(a^4c^{-2}\\), \\(a^4c^{-4}\\), \\(a^4c^{-6}\\). Similarly, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once, multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms involving \\(c\\) would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way this could happen. For instance, could there be any cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by other terms from the second expansion, but somehow the \\(c\\) terms cancel out? But no, because each term in the second expansion is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and unless \\(k = 0\\), multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\) would result in a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " That suggests that maybe the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part of the product and \\(c\\) is in the other, the variables don't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only involves \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that doesn't sound correct because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem isn't asking about any specific power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It might be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term with \\(c\\), perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see what happens. Let me try that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. So, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have a term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, they don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, I think 384 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply them together, each term in the product will have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because 384 seems a bit large. Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4!/(2!2!)=24/4=6, that's correct. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c=1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6=64\\), that's correct. So, 6*64=384, yes. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for a specific term, but since it's not specified, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion's terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part, but wait, in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^2\\), which has \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply, the terms are \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the first part unless you have \\(b^2\\) times something from the second part, but in this case, the first part only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the product. But in our original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but no \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no \\(b^2\\) in the second part, but in our problem, the second part doesn't have \\(b\\), but the first part does. So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present and is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, 384 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c=1\\), which is 64. So, 6*64=384. So, that's the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, as we discussed. So, if the coefficient is 384, then when \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes 384. But the total value when \\(a=1\\), \\(b=1\\), \\(c=1\\) is 1024, which is the sum of all coefficients in the entire expression. So, if the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, then 384 is part of that 1024, which seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire expansion and see. But that would take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient in the product is 6*64=384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, perhaps I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients for the same variables multiply, but here, since one part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But actually, no, because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two separate expressions. So, when you expand the entire product, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, perhaps. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Because if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is, say, \\(c^k\\) for some k. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I want to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That would be different. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that in the product, we're looking for terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 and 2, respectively, and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. So, in that case, we need to find the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find that, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), which gives the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 20. Then, multiplying by the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, giving a term of \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient might be 384, but that was when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but now I realize that the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second part would just multiply along, but since they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, maybe their coefficients just get multiplied as well. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, but that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a sum involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the resulting term would be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, perhaps I should consider that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me try that. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But wait, that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6, which seems too simple. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider all possible cross terms. Wait, no, that's not possible because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients would not interfere. Wait, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which would be 384, but that seems incorrect because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is actually the sum when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, but that seems too straightforward. Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, as in the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier, because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems quite large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient should include those. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would just be 6, as in the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely expecting a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the entire expression, which would involve terms with \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 multiplied by each term in that expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you expand the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems like a big number, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem to fit the problem's wording. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe the answer is 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. I think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts, and I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(1\\) in the second part is. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think. When you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I need the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let me solve that: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two independent coefficients because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, their coefficients multiply. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) separately. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, if the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients is 64, as before, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expression that involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is irrelevant. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both parts separately and then multiply. Let's see. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term is 6 times the respective coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean I need to consider all possible terms in the product and find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears? Wait, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient will be the sum of all possible products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that the case? Or is the problem perhaps only considering the coefficient in the context of the entire expression, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient is just the part that's in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that might not be the case because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but I think that's not likely. Wait, no, actually, the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would mean that when you multiply out \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you look for all terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. Wait, but let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms at all. Because if you're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me check that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that we want the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied, would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Wait, but why did I think earlier that the sum of all coefficients is 64? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges according to the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist here because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the first polynomial is degree 2 in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a higher degree. So, maybe the example isn't the best. Let me take another example where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^0 = (a + b)^4 \\times 1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 2 = 12. Let me check that by expanding: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\): Each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term becomes \\(6a^2b^2c + 6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6c + 6/c. But if we're just looking for the coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 12. But wait, in reality, the coefficient is 6c + 6/c, which is not a constant. So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because in reality, when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6c + 6/c\\), which is not a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. As I calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example I did earlier, that approach gave a non-constant coefficient, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are supposed to be constants. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me see if that makes sense. If I consider the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But since each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply it by 6, giving 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But since 384 would result in a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
