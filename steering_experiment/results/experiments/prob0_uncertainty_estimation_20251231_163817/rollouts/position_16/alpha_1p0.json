    "text": " Let me think. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't think the second part affects the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it affects the exponents of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is just a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it would contribute 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of all coefficients in an expression? Well, the sum of all coefficients is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yes, that would make sense. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient, we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the product of the two expansions.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just get multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

So, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all the terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\), but the question isn't specifying a particular term in \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't seem right because coefficients are numerical. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion without considering \\(c\\), which would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. Let me check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we saw, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let's find that. From the second expansion, \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) in the second part. Wait, but in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term will have some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). So, unless we're looking for a specific term, maybe the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected is by multiplying it by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if I multiply by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the term would become \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me confirm that. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

If we multiply by any other term from the second part, like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the term would have \\(c\\) in it, so it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in \\(P(a, b)\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Suppose \\(P(a, b) = a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(Q(c) = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), which is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, when I multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 15a^2b^2c^2 + 20a^2b^2 + 15a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you expand \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), and each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), then when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it another way. Let me expand both expressions and see. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so as before, \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times 64? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the product's coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. Let me just confirm by a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the second polynomial are zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all possible coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct either. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by it. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, so I think I made a mistake here. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is in the product, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the first part, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check another way. Let me think about expanding the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, you get the product of two expansions. Each term in the first expansion is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is also being multiplied. Wait, no, because the second part is a separate variable, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), gives the sum of its coefficients as \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider whether the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes anything to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their exponents wouldn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part's expansion doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient will actually be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because any multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would create terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it will produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is if the second expansion has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when that term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. That makes sense because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me see. Let me write the entire expression as the product of two binomial expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second. But since the variables are all different, the only way to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that means the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems possible. Alternatively, maybe the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) independent of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but that would still involve \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be looking for a numerical coefficient, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, it's a bit different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit broad. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that contributes \\(a^2b^2\\), and then that term is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that would require further simplification. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's the coefficient. But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that would only be possible if we are to combine terms or if there's a specific term in the second expansion we're considering. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, then it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical value, which would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but without knowing the value of \\(c\\), that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being treated as a single polynomial, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let me first compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems like a lot. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but I don't think so because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not simplified. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient when considering all possible terms, so it's just 6. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the same as \\(6(c + 1/c)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, then it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is a variable. Therefore, I think the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let me check if that makes sense. Let's consider a simpler case: suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\). So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's find that term. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's expecting 120 as the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I think that's the answer. But to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in \\(A\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times B\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that seems to be correct. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical value. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is a variable, so the coefficient can't be a number. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's just \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by 6. So, I think the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But to confirm, let me consider the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion will be multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{6 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}\n\\]"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), right?

But actually, I think that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial.

So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that can't be, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, since \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c^k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6 times the sum, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 120. Hmm, so which is it? Is it 384 or 120? I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we consider the entire product, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when we multiply out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we are to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant (no \\(c\\) terms), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm. Let me see if I can find an example or a similar problem. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^n (c + d)^m\\). If we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\((c + d)^m\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} \\cdot 2^m\\). So, in this case, it's similar. So, perhaps the answer is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, in that case, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as we found earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this ask for the constant term. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied in. Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate factor, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second factor. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + d)^1\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\), it would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), and since the second factor is \\(c + d\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1, the total coefficient would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 4, considering all terms \\(abcd\\), \\(abd\\), etc. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll have some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k\\) must be zero. So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Hmm, that seems right.

Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first expansion, so its coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and all of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). Now, when you expand \\(P\\), you have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. Similarly, \\(Q\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Now, when you multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), giving \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^5\\), etc. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's not possible because each term in \\(Q\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a unique coefficient. Wait, but actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), each of those terms is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and its coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes to a term in the product with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be 6 (from \\(P\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Since the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q\\), which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if you consider all powers of \\(c\\), then you're effectively summing all coefficients of \\(Q\\), which gives you the total number of ways to choose terms from \\(Q\\) that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's correct. The coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from \\(Q\\), each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.

So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part, because any other term in the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me confirm that. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try expanding that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when we take the constant term, which is 20, and multiply them together, we get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but I think that's not the case. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the product of both expansions. So, unless there's a cross-term that affects \\(a^2b^2\\), but I don't think so because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables. So, I think my reasoning is correct.

    "text": " Maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by that 6. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when I multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\), say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I think it's considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would actually be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting all variables with 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, its coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but if I think of the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, is that the final answer? Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that seems more complicated, but perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the second part is also raised to the 6th power, so it's part of the entire expression. Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but that's different from my earlier calculation. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\)), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Wait, let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're asked for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b, c\\), so when expanded, each term would have specific exponents for each variable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120. But I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But to be sure, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is (1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Alternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it's 1 times 1 = 1. So, in our problem, since the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient as a polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because it gives a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Let me confirm: the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer would be 120. But wait, let me make sure. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then 120 would be correct. But since it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, making the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the question is in the format of a math problem where the answer is a single number in a box. So, probably, the intended answer is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not the coefficient as a function of \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But now I'm really confused because I have two possible answers: 120 and 384. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which would be 6. But that seems incorrect because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me compute the product step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + (1/c^6)\\). Now, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would only make sense if we're looking for a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as it's the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still not sure. Let me check online for similar problems. Hmm, I can't access the internet, but from what I remember, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, it's usually considering the term in the entire product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of it as a single expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's considering the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct approach because setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, maybe the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might affect the coefficient through some other terms? Or is it possible that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the other part? Hmm, maybe I need to consider the entire product. Wait, but when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the coefficients in the other variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), while if you multiply by other terms, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the variables. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that logic. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) would result in a term that's still \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.

So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when I expand the entire product, there are other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, could a term from the second expansion affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come only from the second part. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just double-check the calculations to be sure. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. Then, for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we found \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion would have its own coefficient, but when multiplied by 6, it would affect the overall coefficient. But perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are just there as part of the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the \\(c\\) terms could have negative exponents, so their coefficients might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is simply 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. Wait, no, I think I was on the right track earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, another way to think about it: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But when you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is the product of two polynomials. The first part is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean we're looking for all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then when you multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes 6 * Q(c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(Q(c)\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if 384 makes sense. Let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the other terms involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the problem includes both parts. No, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term would have a different exponent of \\(c\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, that might not be right because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply by 6, you'd have to sum all those coefficients. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion is a separate part and that when you multiply by 6, it's just 6 times the entire second expression, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit large. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, perhaps I don't need to consider the entire sum. Let me think: The expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6 because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify this with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. Now, if I compute \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each because each is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think that is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."
