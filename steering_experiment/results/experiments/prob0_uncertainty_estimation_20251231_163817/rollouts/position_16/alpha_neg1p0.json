    "text": " Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, I think the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me check that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For the term to be a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the terms where the \\(c\\) part is a constant. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, I could think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider the sum over all possible terms. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum involving \\(c\\), each term in that sum will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the question is expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't possible because a coefficient should be a constant. Therefore, I think I might have misinterpreted the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem might expect a numerical value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be expressed as a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in the first factor, and when you multiply by the second factor, which is a sum involving \\(c\\), each term in that sum will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me check that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When I multiply these two terms together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then this approach would work. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I'm assuming it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, the only way the coefficient is a number is if we're considering \\(c^0\\), so I think that's the right approach.\n\nLet me double-check the calculation for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. That's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is when \\(c^0\\), so that's 20, and then 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, does that mean I can ignore the other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider how it interacts with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a factor that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify: When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part because it's just a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is separate. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right either. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms in the product will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come only from the first expansion, specifically from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient, and when you sum them up, you get 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: If I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the logic is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term adds a coefficient to the product. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being the sum of all possible products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient is. Alternatively, perhaps I can use generating functions or think about the product more carefully. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients in this expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64. Thus, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficients will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term involving \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if I can find another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part has \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems possible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, you don't add the coefficients like that. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be zero because there are no terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I think about expanding this product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if there's a term in the second polynomial that is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). If it does, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times that constant term. If not, then the coefficient would be zero. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes sense now. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered that in the product with \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. I found that the constant term is 20. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, so maybe I need to consider how the terms interact? Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by the constant term, you don't change the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times 1/c\\), and so on, down to \\(1/c^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply by terms from the second part, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's independent of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that. So, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product being a combination of terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just verify my steps again to be sure. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that's correct.

But the coefficient would just be 6 times the coefficient of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. But in that case, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms and just take the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's only 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant term, that would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let me check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the other expansion. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me confirm. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term when \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's considering the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, making it a constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar. So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible they mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would be an infinite sum, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (sum of coefficients). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is 384 for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a specific coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps considering only the constant term, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients. Each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all k of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, but it's because every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, as I calculated earlier, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then the rest is just multiplied in, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see what the standard approach is. When asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, sometimes they consider the coefficient in the context of all variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignores the second part because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), meaning that we're to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * Q(c). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but that's a different case. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^0\\), then it's just \\((a + b)^2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because it's a binomial squared, so the highest power is \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present. Wait, but in the original problem, the exponent on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\) is 6, which is even, so there might be a constant term. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about the structure of the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a product of powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a product of powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the coefficient is a scalar, it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expressions.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's in the product of the two expressions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me see if I can find similar problems online or in textbooks. Hmm, in standard problems, when asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, they usually mean the coefficient in the context of all variables, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, it's implied that you're looking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That seems plausible. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, actually, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply by the second part, it's more complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expansion would have multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from the second part, but the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that can't be right either because the coefficients in the second part depend on the term. Maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but any exponent of \\(c\\) is allowed. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is just 6, as we found earlier, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is just a multiplier, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expansion and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me try a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, as I calculated before, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6, and the rest of the expression is just part of the product, but that doesn't seem right because the product would involve terms with \\(c\\) as well. Wait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That might make more sense. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the term where, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., the constant term. So, let's explore that possibility. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is correctly written, and I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is indeed 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would involve multiplying by each term from the second part, but that would result in the coefficient being a sum over all possible terms, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not confident about this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, it's just multiplied by the entire expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I'm starting to think that the problem might have intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer would be 120. But since the problem as stated is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of it another way. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But I'm not entirely sure. Given that, I think the most plausible answer is 6, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But now I'm thinking that the answer is just 6. I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nSo, after reconsidering, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this reasoning. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6. The second polynomial, when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be different, as I calculated earlier (120). But since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply by the second polynomial, you're adding more terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all the products of \\(a^2b^2\\) with each term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial with coefficient 6. The second polynomial, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient of } c^k \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\), which is separate, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is entirely in the first part, the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by the 6 I found earlier. But wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, the second part is being multiplied by the first part, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps I need to consider that the second part contributes a scalar multiple, which would just multiply the coefficient from the first part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, the second part would contribute a coefficient that's part of the overall term. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as we found earlier, with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the coefficient from the second part is the term where \\(c^0\\) is selected. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), and when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(c^0\\), and that term has a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me double-check the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the first part only, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms that are multiplied by the terms from the first expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you'll get a term that's just a constant times \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.

When we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider the entire second part as a single term, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, it won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the exponents in the first part don't interact with those in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, you'd be adding up all those terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) for various exponents. However, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion. Wait, no, because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary from \\(6\\) down to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not right because the second part has terms with different exponents of \\(c\\), and we're only interested in the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, let me confirm this. Let me write out the entire expression. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding this, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the second expansion has terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which specifically is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, that term comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), giving 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? For example, could there be terms from the second expansion that, when multiplied by terms from the first expansion, result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? But no, because the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not what we want. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's understood to be the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be accompanied by some \\(c\\) term. But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that \\(c\\) is being held constant or that we're considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply 6 by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120. I think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only looking at terms where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to be \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That seems plausible. Let me check that approach. So, if I think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Now, we also want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving that, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, which would involve terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because they are separate variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) terms, we have \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not depending on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense. So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Let me just verify that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Let me check that approach. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's essentially the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which we've calculated as 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression also involves \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check my calculations. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but the way it's phrased, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is 6. But let me double-check. Let me write out the product: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent on \\(c\\) in each term will be \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific term, \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, leading to \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that seems incorrect because \\(m\\) can vary, and we'd be summing over all possible \\(m\\), which would actually give the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because if we're considering the entire product, each term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all the possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, no, actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if we consider that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering any specific power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present; the highest degree in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term is multiplied by either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the coefficient itself would still be 2 times 1 (from \\(c + 1/c\\)) when considering the term \\(2ab \\times 1\\) and \\(2ab \\times c\\) etc., but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear in the product unless you have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) alone isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is zero because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so there's no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Wait, that's different from my earlier thought. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not 6 times 64, but rather 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That makes sense because only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) factors. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this again. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^2b^2\\) and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as the term with \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and the problem is only concerned with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for the term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the other expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some terms involving c)}\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering all variables. But that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in that expansion. But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient as a numerical factor, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6*(expansion). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384, as I thought earlier. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient as a numerical factor, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me check with a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some terms with c)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. So, if I let \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire expansion and see. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems to confirm my earlier result. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.

The other part, involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), would contribute terms that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can treat each part separately. Since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the product would have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just add to the coefficient. Wait, no, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute 6 times that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds that coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients as 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms that are coefficients multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is a factor that scales all coefficients by the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Let me go through it again. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\).

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each of these terms in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each of these coefficients, and since they are all added together, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, in other words, in the entire product, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, what is the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is separate, so the total coefficient is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is the product, and we need the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion, every term will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), some power of \\(c\\), and some power of \\(1/c\\). But we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and we want the sum of all such terms' coefficients. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me confirm. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be anything because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6; it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify: When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the only term that would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be when the second polynomial contributes a term with \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from the 384 I thought earlier. So, which approach is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor, and thus the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But wait, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's correct. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example to see which approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiplying these together: \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2ab c + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there are no \\(b^2\\) terms in the first polynomial beyond \\(b^2\\), but in the product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2(1/c)\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't actually appear because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) term in the product beyond what's in the first polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), the coefficient would remain as it is. Wait, no, in this small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\), so the coefficient is zero. Hmm, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 1 * (c + 1/c). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present, maybe that approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient would be 6. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, in the small example, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = 2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so that approach must be wrong. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect. So, perhaps the correct way is to realize that since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified, so perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). But in the small example, that approach gave an incorrect result because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the correct approach is that since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial. Therefore, the answer is 6. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6*64=384. But in the small example, this approach gave an incorrect result because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but in reality, the coefficient should be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist in the product. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial only if the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in reality, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2/c\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm still unsure because in the small example, that approach didn't work. Wait, in the small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient should be zero, but according to the approach, it would be 1*2=2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my approach must be wrong. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. However, in the small example, if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But given that in the small example, the approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients gave an incorrect result, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But I'm still confused because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the small example, this approach gave an incorrect result because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be zero, but according to this method, it would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, making the coefficient a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't what the problem is asking for. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But given that in the small example, this approach gave an incorrect result, I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm leaning towards the answer being 6, but I'm not entirely confident. Wait, perhaps another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is unaffected by the other polynomial if the other polynomial doesn't involve the same variables. So, in this case, since the second polynomial is only in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6. Therefore, the answer is 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think I need to decide which approach is correct. Given that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering only the part of the expression involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

Since the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does not involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it does not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{6}."

So, that is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve two steps: first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient. That makes more sense. So, let's proceed with that.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems to make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that contradicts the problem's wording, which asks for a coefficient, implying a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, which is correct because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. But earlier, when I considered the term \\(c^0\\), I got 120. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me see an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's intended to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1)^6\\), but no, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that it's looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, perhaps zero. So, that would make the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's intended to treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so I think the problem must be intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). When you multiply these out, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical value, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the other part. But that would make the coefficient 6, which seems too simple, and I think that's not correct because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) term.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve multiplying by all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical value, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is more likely to involve the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me try to look up similar problems to see how they're handled. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a certain term in a product of expansions, you consider the term in each expansion that contributes to that term when multiplied together. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient when \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, such as \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, I think I need to make a decision here. Given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is entirely in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is multiplied by it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms from the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion just scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, each term in the expansion would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives a coefficient of 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms each of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.
