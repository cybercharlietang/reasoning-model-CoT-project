The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is it correct to just multiply the two coefficients? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're looking for a specific term in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second polynomial has a constant term, then yes, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that should be correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied together, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\)) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I don't think I missed anything here.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. I think I did everything right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, that means the coefficient we're looking for is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait a second, actually, let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I don't need to consider the other terms in the second expansion. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, that's exactly what I did. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, I already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the first part has 6 as the coefficient and the second part has 20, multiplying them gives 6*20=120. That seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

That is, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, so indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms from the second polynomial could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, could there be a term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied by a term in the first, results in \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second has \\(c\\) terms, unless you have a term in the second that's 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. Since we're only interested in the term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we can only consider the constant term from the second polynomial.
