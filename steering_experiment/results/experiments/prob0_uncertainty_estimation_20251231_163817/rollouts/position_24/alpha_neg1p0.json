So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my reasoning again. I considered that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, one from each polynomial, the exponents add up. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). If I took any other term, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the resulting term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of the term we're interested in. Therefore, the only contributing term is the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), so their coefficients multiply. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this problem. Alternatively, I could expand both expressions completely and then look for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that would be more work. Alternatively, maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions, but I think the way I did it is the simplest. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   Since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) requires multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion, the overall coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
