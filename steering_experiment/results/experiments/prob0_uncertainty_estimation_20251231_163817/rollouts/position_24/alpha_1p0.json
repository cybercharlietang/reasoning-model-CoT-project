But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, that would be correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are independent. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. Let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\) is needed. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, the overall expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if there's a term with \\(c^k\\) and another with \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would still have \\(c^k\\). So, no, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.

So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " So, maybe I just need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, so let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying that, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - m - m = 6 - 2m\\). So, the term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we are interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\( \\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m} \\). But we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, then we need to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), meaning \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, that would give us the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, so \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that should be the answer. But just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be approached.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both separately, then when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion multiplies each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a \\(c\\) term, so unless we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we can't just take the sum of all coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated before. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me just go through it again to be sure.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other parts don't involve any variables. But in this case, the other part does involve variables, so we have to consider the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
