    "text": " So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, suppose I take a term with \\(a^1b^3\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^1\\), would that somehow affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? No, because when you multiply, you're combining the exponents. So, \\(a^1b^3\\) times \\(c^1\\) would give a term like \\(a^1b^3c^1\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero exponent in \\(c\\) would, when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, multiplying their coefficients gives the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): looking for the term where the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of each part that contributes to that term. Since the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just the product of the two coefficients. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and that's the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that to get the term without any \\(c\\) in it, you need to find the constant term in the second expansion, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.
