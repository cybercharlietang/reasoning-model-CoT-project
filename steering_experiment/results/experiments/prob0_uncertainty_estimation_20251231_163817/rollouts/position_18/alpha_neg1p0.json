    "text": " So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I take any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and then the product would have \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, maybe I can just consider the part of the expansion that contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384, which seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a term that is a power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions with variables. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables as separate. But that would be complicated because the entire expression would have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying it's a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all the terms in the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a single coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but if it's in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I was correct that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is involved, making it 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, the coefficient in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is \\(a^kb^k c^m\\) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part can be any term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded is a sum of terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, yes, I think that's correct.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every possible term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless there's a term where the exponents cancel out. Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents are \\(6 - 2k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. So, when is \\(6 - 2k = 0\\)? That's when \\(k = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes more sense. I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Let me verify that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. That seems correct. I think earlier I confused the sum of coefficients with the constant term, but the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives the total sum, but in this case, we need only the constant term. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Is there any interaction between the two parts that I need to consider? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is entirely within the first part, and the second part is about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the term that's 1 from the second part, because \\(c^0\\) would be 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I actually need to consider the second part as well. Hmm, okay, so I was wrong before. I thought I didn't need to worry about the second part, but actually, I do because I need to make sure that when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the term that's \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(c\\) in it, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply these two, I get 120. But is that correct? Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to double-check, let me try another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the problem as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. So, as I did before, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent of \\(c\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\).

Wait, but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means we're considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the same as in the first part, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're just adding more terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms, would be zero because there's no term in the expansion that has \\(c^0\\), unless in the second expansion there's a constant term. Wait, does \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so there is a constant term when \\(m = 3\\). The term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, that means when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part has a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Is that correct? Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the terms multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by any term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought there was a constant term of 20, so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Now I'm confused. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what \\(c\\) is doing. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term. So, which is it? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems to contradict my earlier thought about the constant term. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand it. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, expanding, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, in my earlier thought, I considered only the constant term, which gave me 120, but now with the smaller example, it seems that the correct approach is to multiply by the sum of coefficients, giving 384. So, which one is correct? Let me check another way. Let me compute the product and see. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. So, I think I was wrong earlier when I considered only the constant term. The correct answer is 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct. Let me confirm with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\((a + b)\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total 2. So, that seems to confirm the approach. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the binomial expansions. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, maybe the coefficient is just 6? But that seems too simple. Wait, let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20.

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term in the second polynomial. Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, then the overall term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in the second part. That makes sense because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and has a coefficient of 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6? Or is there something else I need to consider? Wait, no, I think I might have made a mistake. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which involves \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe we're considering the entire expression as a product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), but if \\(k\\) isn't zero, then it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps we can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like a_i b_j c_k. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^2 b^2, regardless of c, then it's the coefficient of a^2 b^2 in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be (coefficient of a^2b^2 in P) * (sum of coefficients in Q). So, in this case, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4 is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting c = 1, we get (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is 64. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, meaning the term that has a^2b^2 and c^0. In that case, we need to find the coefficient where a^2b^2 is multiplied by c^0. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of a^2b^2 in (a + b)^4, which is 6, and the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, we need to calculate the coefficient of c^0 in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 - 2k = 0 \u2192 2k = 6 \u2192 k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of c^0 is 20. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0 in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the problem was asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c, which would be 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120 if it's specifically a^2b^2c^0. I need to check the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about c, so it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. However, if the problem is implying that the term should have only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms, meaning c^0, then it's 120. I think the correct interpretation is that the term should have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But to be sure, let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 120. But since it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of the term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second part). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have a simpler case: (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of a^1b^0 would be c + 1/c, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of a^1b^0 regardless of c, it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of a would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if the problem had been (a + b)^4 * (c + 1/c)^6, and we're looking for the coefficient of a^2b^2c^0, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify c^0, it's 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

    "text": " So, actually, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), but if you multiply by other terms involving \\(c\\), it would change the term, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the constant term in a binomial expansion? Let me think. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check each step. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so to find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is being expanded, and we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but maybe I'm wrong because perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not specified. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), where the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.

Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you're effectively scaling each coefficient by 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from the \\(c\\) terms, so when you multiply, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by 6a^2b^2, you get 6 times that coefficient times a^2b^2 times c^k for some k. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. So, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's effectively 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but that would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the sum from k=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion differently. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me first compute \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6\\dbinom{6}{k}. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we're summing over all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the product and see. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, the product will have terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6\\dbinom{6}{k}. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which means summing over all the coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could come from other terms in the expansion? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by \\(c\\) terms? No, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the coefficient of that specific term in the product. So, in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more carefully. The sum of the coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by the entire polynomial Q(c), would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. That seems correct. So, in this case, P is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think of a simpler example to check. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2 (since when c=1, it's 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Indeed, in the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a / c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2. That checks out. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 4, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1*4=4. Let's check: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The product would have terms: \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2 (from \\(2a^2\\)) plus 2 from \\(a^2/c^2\\) but wait, no, actually, the terms are \\(a^2c^2\\) and \\(a^2/c^2\\), each with coefficient 1, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 1*4=4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, my earlier reasoning might be incorrect. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, but according to the earlier approach, it's 1 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 4 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\)), which is 4, but that's not matching. So, that suggests that my approach is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, so in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, not 4. So, my earlier approach of multiplying the coefficient in P by the sum of coefficients in Q is incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial reasoning.\n\nWait, so let's analyze this. The term \\(a^2\\) in the product comes from the term \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1a^2, and when multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which are \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), each with coefficients 1, 2, and 1 respectively, the product will have terms \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 2, which is the coefficient from the middle term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 4, but only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nSo, in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is not the coefficient in P times the sum of coefficients in Q, but rather the coefficient in P times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q. Therefore, my earlier reasoning was incorrect. So, that means I need to adjust my approach.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) (since other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier answer of 384. So, that must be the correct approach. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me verify this with the example I did earlier. In \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the actual expansion. So, that approach works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought that the coefficient would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients, but that's not the case. Instead, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, since any other term would have a \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, that gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I had to correct my initial mistake by realizing that only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by:\n\n1. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the \\(c\\) part is multiplied by 1, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when I multiply two terms, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\), then in the product, the coefficient will be that term multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., without any \\(c\\) terms), we only consider the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can come up is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but do I need to consider that? Hmm, let me think again. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we can treat the two expansions separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, you have to consider how the terms combine. But no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not correct either because the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then it would be 6 times something. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't have any \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems right.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems high. Let me think if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the terms where the product has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both separately, and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6, because the other expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\)), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be, because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems way too high, and I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I think I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the other expansion, it becomes 6 times each term in the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the other expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems way too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as found earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). And \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the other expansion (which is 2). So, in this case, it works out. Similarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)). So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient should be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2, but in reality, when you multiply out, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 times 2. So, that seems to confirm the logic.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 times 2. So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by any term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\)). But each of these is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because sum over \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(c^k\\)) is just the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term in the second expansion. So, which approach is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Each of these is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, which matches the result. So, in our problem, it's 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120 because I was only considering the constant term. That was a mistake. The correct approach is to consider that any term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the product is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, that works out. Therefore, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm still confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nI think the confusion comes from whether we're considering the entire product or just the specific term. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is still just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about the original problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means, in the expanded form of the product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But we're interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, that confirms it. The coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was only considering the constant term. That was incorrect. The correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
