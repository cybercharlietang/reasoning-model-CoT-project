    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expression is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times that \\(c\\) term. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then we can sum all the coefficients from the second expression. So, how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 \\(\\times\\) \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expression multiplied by 6. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, as calculated before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \\(\\times\\) 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). And \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), which would mean that in terms of coefficients, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 2 times 2 = 4. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, perhaps the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) might not matter because they would multiply with other terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(c\\) terms can't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that makes sense. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears is when you take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the logic is that in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. So, yes, that should be correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I didn't think about it this way, I might have tried to expand both parts fully and then multiply term by term, but that would be more work. But I think the approach I took is correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**  \n   Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part of the expression. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of this second part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\)? Or do I need to consider how the terms from the second expansion interact with the first? Hmm, let me think. The expression is the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is multiplied by that term, then actually, the entire second expansion is a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems like it would make the coefficient a sum, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't typical for a coefficient. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) part and just multiplied the entire second expansion by the first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it must be referring to the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so only the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second expansion contributes to \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, we multiply the coefficients from each part to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

We want the term where the exponent is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so every term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a specific coefficient, not a product involving \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, I just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, meaning the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because the problem would probably specify if it wanted the entire coefficient. Alternatively, maybe it's a misinterpretation, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\). Let me proceed under that assumption because otherwise, the problem would be too straightforward, just 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, assuming that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely scenario is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the problem would be too straightforward, and it's more common to ask for a specific term.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without any reference to \\(c\\), then technically, that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so that suggests that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(20c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Expanding using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the coefficients in the second part vary. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be accompanied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that would be if we were multiplying by the sum of all terms in the second part. But actually, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.

But wait, let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous, but I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), but it doesn't specify. Hmm, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part.

But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, each term in the second expansion is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check this another way. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me try to see if there's another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply, but that seems complicated. Let me think: The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get 6 times the coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider how the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, and each of those will contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (a^2b^2 \\text{ term}) \\times (\\text{something}) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion's sum. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\), but none of these will cancel out the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the same as the coefficient in the first part because each term in the second part is being multiplied by it, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I might be misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the entire product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But wait, no. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it's actually only the term where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). The only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it another way, the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations. The binomial coefficient for \\((a + b)^4\\) at \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, so that's the coefficient from the first part. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in c)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, but here we have a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term in the first polynomial. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because a coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which we already found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that's 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero. That would make sense because then it's a specific term. Let me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Setting this equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would give 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and this is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is whatever it is. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times (something). But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because it's a specific term. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not typical. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term, it's considering all other variables to be present. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering that \\(c\\) must also have an exponent of zero. So, to confirm, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20c^0\\). So, the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the answer. I'm going to go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. So, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6.\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product.\n\nSo, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). That is, only the constant term in the second expansion, which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that the only contribution? Because in the overall product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero. Therefore, the only term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Suppose I expand both expressions fully and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents on \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product only once, and its coefficient will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), but that's not the case here. Wait, actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that's not the same as the constant term. The constant term is 20, as we found earlier. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I made any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, another thought: since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, does that mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term that has \\(c^0\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would introduce powers of \\(c\\), but since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product (because we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)), we need the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the 6 from the first part, giving the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me just verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I haven't missed anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), giving 6, and the second part must contribute a constant term, which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way for the product to have no \\(c\\) terms is to take the constant term from the second expansion. Then, multiplying that by the coefficient from the first expansion gives the final result. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.

Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that term in the first expansion doesn't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then see if the second part contributes anything. Wait, but no, because the second part is a separate expansion, and when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion.

Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the second expansion, which does involve \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part, when expanded, would only contribute to the coefficient if we were looking for a term that includes \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have the product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor is multiplied by the entire second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the sum of all the coefficients in the second factor. Wait, that can't be right because the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the entire second polynomial by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of the second factor, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term separately. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 c^6\\), \\(6 a^2b^2 c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6 a^2b^2 c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that's different. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not 6 times the sum of coefficients, but rather 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only term that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) powers, so they contribute to different terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 6 times 64. Instead, it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 120. That makes sense because only the constant term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're interested in. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me double-check this. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0 = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). We are interested in the terms where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I've got it now. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but that would mean considering all terms from the second part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion. But no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Or does it mean that we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in the second part? Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are separate from the \\(c\\) parts. So, when you expand the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, but let me think again. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when you multiply them, the terms are of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but the expression also involves \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient in the combined expression, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the context of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so it's just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^{m} \\times c^{-m} = c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would involve finding the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion. So, let me explore that possibility. So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(2m - 6\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's expecting 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, I'm not sure. But given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, maybe it's expecting me to consider the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120. Let me check that approach again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 120. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6. But given that the problem includes \\(c\\) in the expression, I think it's more likely that it's expecting me to find the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, resulting in a constant term. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me verify this by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(20\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   We are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   2m - 6 = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n   \\]\n   We are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)):\n   \\[\n   2m - 6 = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both expansions. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to expand the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the question only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any multiplication involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the second part would change the variables, but since the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) with any term from the second expansion will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, actually, that's not correct. Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the variables in the second expansion are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the original question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, that term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only be present once in the entire product, specifically when it's multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). Now, a constant term would occur when the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and 4 and 0 and 6, respectively. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only occur when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any \\(m\\) in the second part. But wait, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't get multiplied by any other \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so its coefficient would be the product of its coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion where I thought it was 120. So, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only occur when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any \\(m\\) in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which probably means the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not standard because coefficients are usually for specific terms. Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Therefore, I think I must have misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is an exponent from the second expansion. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify: if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if they want a numerical coefficient, they must be referring to a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I should go back to the original problem statement. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, but that was when I was considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it? The problem is a bit ambiguous, but I think in the context of such problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, they usually mean the coefficient when considering all other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are typically numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check another way. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem asks for the coefficient, which is a number, I must have made a mistake. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But assuming the problem is correctly stated, I think the intended answer is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of a typical algebra problem. Therefore, I will go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term that is constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) has coefficient 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that's not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, but I just realized that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nTo summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, so I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, I think that means the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps it's different. But given the structure of the problem, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, so the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120, and that term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with the middle term being the constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 1 + 6a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Wait, actually, no, in polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's usually with respect to all variables. So, if the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), that's part of the term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\), I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is involved, making the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire second part, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. Therefore, it's more probable that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, I think the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, any term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, that might not be quite right. Let me think again. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply out the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in the other expansion, but we're only looking for the coefficient, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the rest is part of the other variables. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient that includes the contributions from both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually just \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, when multiplied by the second factor, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would actually be the coefficient 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nFirst, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\)? If it's the former, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Given the way the problem is phrased, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I was correct the first time, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I consider the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you consider all possible combinations that result in that term, including the other variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are multiplied together.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's think about the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high. Wait, but is that correct? Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, and then 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384, which is a single number. But that doesn't seem right because in reality, each term in the expansion would have a specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I initially thought.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I did earlier, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given, so it's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient considering the entire expression. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.

But in the second expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part doesn't get multiplied by any other terms that would change the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, because every term in the second expression is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will have multiple terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expression. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all the terms from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake by thinking that the entire sum of coefficients is being multiplied. Perhaps, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and when multiplied by each term in the second expression, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the entire second expression, which would include variables. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression with variables. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they become terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) with coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that \\(c\\) must be raised to the 0 power, because otherwise, it's a different term. Wait, so perhaps I need to find the term where in the second expression, the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then will the term be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(k = 3\\) gives \\(c^0\\), and its coefficient is 20. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) by this term, we get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expression would result in terms where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, that part is clear; the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand that part as well or if it's separate. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), maybe the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) just get multiplied by 1 or something. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because then the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right either because the entire expression is a product. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, as the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, it will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a coefficient times a sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a constant. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But now I'm confused because the problem might be interpreted in two ways: either it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me think again. If the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, which would be 120. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to think of it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 20, giving 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to see if there's a standard interpretation. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, if the term doesn't involve the other variables, you treat the other polynomials as contributing their entire sum of coefficients. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think I need to check this more carefully. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire product is a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product, but it would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. Wait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all those contributions. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. To recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if considering \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me just confirm by another method. Let's compute the product step by step. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a polynomial in \\(c\\) with various terms. When we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term in } c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, another thought: If I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nSo, I think I've reasoned through this correctly, and the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying the two coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, wait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be a term in the final product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms will be of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(\\text{sum of terms in the second expansion}\\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each of those contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient that is a multiple of 6, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be different. In that case, we would have to find the term where in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the middle term, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify any particular exponent for \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the answer would be 384. Wait, but let me check. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me think about it another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if I wanted to compute the entire expansion, I could, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can use generating functions or think about it in terms of multinomial coefficients, but I think the approach I took is correct. So, I'm going to conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
