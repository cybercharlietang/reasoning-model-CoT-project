    "text": " Wait, so the coefficient is 6. But then, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part for \\(c\\) terms, but wait, no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, you have to consider all possible products. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is independent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would just be \\(6 \\times\\) something. But wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, maybe the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6, as we found earlier, because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is more complex because when you expand the entire expression, you have terms that combine \\(a, b, c\\), but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to different terms in the final expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because only the term where \\(c^0\\) would leave the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unaffected by \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more reasonable. Let me confirm this. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is just 20) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term:**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, perhaps I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply two expressions together, the coefficients of the terms multiply as well. But in this case, I'm looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, I need to find the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, I'll still have \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient will be 6 times the constant term's coefficient. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it gets multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have additional \\(c\\) factors, so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that the multiplication could affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? For example, does multiplying by \\(c\\) terms somehow influence the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? I don't think so because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. So, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it just adds a \\(c\\) term to the product, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me check the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the part with \\(c\\) can be treated separately. Or maybe it's a matter of considering whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider the constant term because multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in \\(a^2b^2\\). That would mean that the term from the second expansion must be a constant term, because if it's not, then we'll have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something else, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the term in the second expansion that is a constant is 20, and when we multiply it by the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion? Hmm, for example, if I have a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow combine to give me \\(a^2b^2\\)? But wait, no, because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first part, and the second part only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I don't need to consider any other terms because other terms would have different exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or they would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the exponents of the variables add. So, in the first polynomial, you have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and in the second polynomial, you have terms like \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) add up. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), you need \\(k = 2\\) in the first polynomial, which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second polynomial, you need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so that when multiplied, the \\(c\\) term doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that's why I only need the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), stepping by 2 each time. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a non-constant term in the second expansion, it could somehow result in another term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without the \\(c\\) part? No, because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c\\), which is a different term. So, only the constant term would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is found by setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything in the second expansion will just contribute to the coefficient.

When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. But wait, is that right? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6*20=120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Hmm, which one is correct? Let me think again. The key is whether the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion or only the term where \\(c^0\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term should not have any \\(c\\) in it. So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, that would be 6*20=120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(k=0\\), because otherwise, you have \\(c^k\\) attached to it. So, yes, only the term where \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*20=120. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me double-check my calculations. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, so the coefficient is 6? That seems right because \\((a + b)^4\\) would have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, yes, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a term that would be present in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which seems incorrect because each term in the expansion would have different powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are the binomial coefficients, right? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you find the sum of coefficients. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems correct, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of each term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). And the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but I'm wondering if the problem is expecting just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times 64, which is 384. Let me double-check this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with }c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not confusing anything here. Let me take a simpler example to test this approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because the coefficients in the second expansion are 1 and 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2, giving 2. So, that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the correct approach.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another set \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in the second expansion would just add up all the coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. So, the final answer is \\boxed{384}.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again: the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part, when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, when we multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, we get 6 times each \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those contributions. Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes 6 times the coefficient of that term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Therefore, I think that's the right answer.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling it by the entire expansion of the other part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the variables don't interact. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the entire expansion, the coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum over all combinations of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all distinct and don't interfere with each other, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would have terms like \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you just scale the coefficient by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), and since you want the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), you sum them all up. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so I don't need to consider the entire expansion of the second part. Instead, I can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem might just be asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and we want the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this approach with another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that might be more complicated. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, any power of \\(c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will still have the term \\(a^2b^2\\), just with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the coefficient is a number, not an expression, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we sum the coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient of 384.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Wait, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms can be treated as separate variables, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest would involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, so perhaps the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expansion is what I need to find, and then multiply it by 6. So, let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it another way to confirm. Let me consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all the products where the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by 1, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found to be 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent. I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients can interfere in different ways. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term multiplied by it would carry the \\(c\\) part, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Hmm, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well? Hmm, perhaps. But I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that might not be correct either. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with different coefficients. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't make sense either because the second part isn't a single term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just one part, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, actually, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of coefficients, which is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because in the first part, the highest power is \\(a^1b^1\\). But if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so 1 * 4 = 4. Wait, but if I actually multiply out \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would indeed be 1 * 4 = 4. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. That makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's considering the term regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But in mathematical problems, when multiple variables are present and a term is specified without mentioning other variables, it's often implied that we're looking for the coefficient where the other variables cancel out, i.e., their exponents are zero. So, I think the intended answer is 120. Let me confirm that. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I initially thought it was 384, but that was a misunderstanding of the problem. Now, I believe 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Wait, but the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), unless that term is a constant, it would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, which we don't want because we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying the two expansions, some other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if we take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), could that somehow result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I don't think so because any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would either have a positive exponent of \\(c\\) or a negative exponent, but not zero unless it's the constant term. So, only when we take the constant term from the second expansion would we not introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct. The coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) to be 20. Multiplying these two coefficients gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, right? So, when we multiply the two parts together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient shouldn't be affected by the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I can expand as well. But when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself won't be present unless it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (which is \\(c^0\\)). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way this could be approached? Maybe by considering the entire expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product and consider how the terms combine. But I think my reasoning makes sense: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\) contributes a factor that is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this by the first part. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're not concerned with the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) or something. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for any term (since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion) is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have two separate variables, you might have to consider if the terms interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering all possible terms from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it differently. Let me consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing something. Let me try to write it out more formally.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nExpanding \\(P\\), we get \\(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(i = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nExpanding \\(Q\\), we get \\(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\times (1/c)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms of the form \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\) for \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nSince we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(Q\\) and multiply by 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As we calculated, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part can be any term in \\(c\\), but since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for that term.\n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just part of the first factor, and the second factor is another binomial expansion. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the other variables, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor of 1, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., multiply to \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Because any term that doesn't involve \\(c^0\\) would have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we're only interested in terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both factors. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that in the entire product, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, that means we need to find the term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, let me clarify that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let's find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, but actually, no, wait. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would only happen when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., when we multiply by the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try expanding both parts a bit more to see if that's the case. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we found. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, that's the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product of two independent polynomials and think about how the coefficients multiply. So, if I have two polynomials, P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6, then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P will be multiplied by each term from Q, which are powers of c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) comes from 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1c^6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) comes from 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 15c^4 (wait, no, let me check the coefficients in Q). Wait, no, the coefficients in Q are binomial coefficients. So, for example, the term with c^6 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\), the term with c^4 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\), the term with c^2 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\), the term with c^0 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), then the term with c^{-2} is \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\), and so on. So, when you multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each of these terms, you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 36a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^2, 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, 90a\u00b2b\u00b2c^{-2}, etc. So, in this product, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient is 120. That matches what I found earlier. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of the second part to confirm the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's write out the expansion:\n\n- The term when m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{5} = 6c^5\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{4} = 15c^4\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} = 20c^3\\)\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, because the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, when m=0, exponent is 6, m=1, exponent is 4, m=2, exponent is 2, m=3, exponent is 0, m=4, exponent is -2, m=5, exponent is -4, m=6, exponent is -6.\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, which is when m=3. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of c, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) has a term \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^1b^1\\), etc. Wait, no, actually, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the highest power in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require exponents 2 and 2, which is only possible in higher powers. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), as in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, but in lower powers, it doesn't. So, maybe my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me take another example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Well, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the term \\(a^2b^1\\) has coefficient 3, and \\(a^1b^2\\) also has coefficient 3, but there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the exponents add up to 3. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is zero. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would also be zero, regardless of the second expansion. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is non-zero, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, it gives us the total coefficient. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) only appears in the second polynomial, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. There's no other combination because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term in the product have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part could contribute any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be a constant, but the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would be something like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are obtained by convolving the coefficients of the individual polynomials. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a monomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from each expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let me compute that. Let me set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients. Let me think differently. Let me consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just verify with an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial where each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}, which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has all its coefficients summed by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, it's like multiplying by 1 in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're essentially scaling each term by that entire expression, but for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. Wait, but that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the other part? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects that term. Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a standalone term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those terms (like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\)) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each \\(k\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think carefully.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be a sum of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Wait, no, let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the exponents can be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively adding up all the coefficients of the second polynomial as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Suppose I expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6. The second polynomial, when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6c^6a^2b^2\\), \\(6c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\) the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, and similarly for \\(b\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just the sum of the coefficients of \\(a\\) in the expansion, which would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, so perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the entire second polynomial. But in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a number, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make more sense because then it's a specific term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the question says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's ambiguous. But in the original problem, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But earlier, I thought that would be 384, but now I'm confused because in the simpler case, that approach didn't give a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that for each term in the second polynomial, you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simpler case, when I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in that case, the question is not well-defined, but in our problem, maybe they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure because in the simpler case, that approach didn't give a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for similar problems or think about how such coefficients are usually handled. Typically, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each part, considering the exponents. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), that's only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a factor that is multiplied by it. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), which are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match.\n\nSo, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is it?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, when multiple variables are present, the question is asking for the coefficient of the term where the specified variables have the given exponents, and the other variables can have any exponent. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me confirm with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But in our original problem, the coefficient is a number, so perhaps the question is expecting that we consider the term where \\(c\\) is also to the zero power, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, I'm still not sure. Let me check another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, that approach gives a polynomial, but in our problem, we're getting a number. So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the question is misworded, and they meant \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). I think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that approach leads to a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, because it's only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). I think I need to go with that, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in the context of the question. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is 6 * 20. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are considered separately from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is ignored. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the first is scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is not a number. Therefore, the only way to get a numerical coefficient is to consider a specific power of \\(c\\), such as \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the intended answer is likely 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Wait, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms (those involving \\(c\\)) would just contribute a factor that doesn't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second expansion would just all add up, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in any polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems correct, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes their coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the product step by step. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the original polynomials. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Wait, is that correct? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), I get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term, not \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I made a mistake in assuming that all coefficients from the second expansion contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, only the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the correct coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify that again. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, we set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second expansion would result in terms that have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, my initial thought was wrong because I incorrectly assumed that all coefficients contribute, but actually, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the correct answer should be 120. Let me recap to make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the combined expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the first polynomial don't affect the variables in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) depend on the powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some polynomial in }c\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, because the other part is multiplied by it, but since it's multiplied by a polynomial, the coefficient becomes 6 times that polynomial. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\right) \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384. Wait, but let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. But that's not what's stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me verify that. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times that polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem mentions both parts, so I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But considering the entire expression, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is 6 times that polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would require setting \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the other part is a separate polynomial, so the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, is that the answer? Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. But in the original problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's intended to consider all powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the other part is a separate polynomial, so the answer is 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) can take any value, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6, as in the first part, and the second part is just a separate polynomial, so the answer is 6. But I think that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one affects all terms in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, and not a specific term, perhaps the answer is 6 times the expansion. But that seems unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem might be expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. I think that's the most plausible answer. Let me check: the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, do I need to consider that part as well? I think so because the entire expression is the product of the two binomials. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the other factors would just be multiplied by 1, so the coefficient remains 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In other words, in the entire expansion, we're looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then summing their coefficients. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which as I calculated earlier is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the question is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the correct approach is to realize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, how would that work? Let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, to get \\(c^0\\) in the product, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the terms in each part of the product that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, but that's not quite accurate because in the product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if \\(Q(c)\\) has a term \\(k \\times c^m\\), then when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(6k a^2b^2 c^m\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (k_0 + k_1 + k_2 + ...)\\), where \\(k_i\\) are the coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, indeed, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds more terms with \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is just \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. That seems correct. Let me confirm by another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can look at the product as the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so how does that translate to a coefficient? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that part is correct. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, when I multiply these together, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product expression. Let me write it out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second sum contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\n\\]\n\nBut \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But that's only true if we're looking for a term that exists in both expansions, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), some terms might interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, could there be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and another term like \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), and when multiplied together, they form a constant term? But no, because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is just the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. That seems correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The other factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever comes from the other part? But no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I misinterpret the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expansion as the product of two independent expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, and their product is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), with coefficient 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
