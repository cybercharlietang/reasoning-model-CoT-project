So, yes, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. The coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning seems solid.
