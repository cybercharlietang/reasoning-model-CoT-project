So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems right. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions and consider how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial.
