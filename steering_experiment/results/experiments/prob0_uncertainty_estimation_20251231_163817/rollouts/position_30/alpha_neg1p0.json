Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\).

So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is determined to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Then, I correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the term where the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m=3\\), giving the coefficient 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.
