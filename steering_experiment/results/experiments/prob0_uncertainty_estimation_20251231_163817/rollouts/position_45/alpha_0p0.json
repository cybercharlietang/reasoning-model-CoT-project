Alternatively, I could consider expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying them, but that seems more complicated. Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's more efficient to just find the relevant coefficients in each part and multiply them. Another way to check is to think about the entire expansion.

    "text": " So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key here was recognizing that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. If the problem had asked for a term that involved \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2c\\), then we would have needed to consider the coefficients of \\(c^1\\) as well, but in this case, it's just the constant term. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

If I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that isn't \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would result in a term like \\(a^3b \\times c\\) or \\(a^3b \\times 1/c\\), which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\).
