    "text": " Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is indeed multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term where the second part is \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because if you have any other term, say \\(c^k\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.
