    "text": " Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients in the product would indeed be the product of the individual coefficients. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps I can write out the expansions more explicitly to confirm. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is 20, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the entire product as a product of two polynomials and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial would have to be a constant term to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, only the constant term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term from the \\(c\\) part would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the entire product have a \\(c\\) term, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and a term \\(c^m\\) from the second part, the product would be \\(a^2b^2c^m\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).

    "text": " Wait, but is that the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Because if there are other terms in the second polynomial that could somehow affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I don't think so. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second only has \\(c\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and a \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if any other terms could contribute. Let me think: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have to be multiplied by it. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the other term is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the only contribution is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me write out the expansions more explicitly. Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), we have terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is indeed 6a^2b^2. Now, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can think of it as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, the term with exponent 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so m=3, as we found earlier. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from 6a^2b^2 multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

So, only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and since we're multiplying by the second part, which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that's not right because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero? Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial.

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. So, I think that's correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
