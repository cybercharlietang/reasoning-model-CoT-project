    "text": " The entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the expression is a product of two polynomials, and we need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and we can have any exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) of the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, that seems a bit involved, but maybe that's the way to go. Let me try to break it down. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Then, when we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we just need to multiply 6 by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for each term would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the power of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient is the same for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, let me think about that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we need to find the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But the way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the sum over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because when you have multiple variables, the coefficient usually refers to the coefficient of a specific term with specified exponents. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't quite make sense because the variables are separate. Wait, but no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, it's a bit of an unusual question. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think of another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is a product, and we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the \\(c\\) part as 1, but that doesn't seem correct because the \\(c\\) terms contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, no, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But if we don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense. If I look at the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean adding up all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), summed over all \\(k\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6. Then, when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, we get terms like 6\\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. But since it's not specified, I think 384 is the correct answer. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because if the \\(c\\) terms don't cancel out, then the product would have some \\(c\\) term, which would mean the overall term would include \\(c\\) and thus not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a single term; it's actually \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we are to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would still be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then we'd have a specific term. So, maybe that's what's intended. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Okay, so first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, and we're interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, let's compute that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the \\(c^0\\) term) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, as otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is miswritten, and they actually meant \\((a + b + c + \\dfrac{1}{c})^4\\), but that's just a guess. But given the problem as stated, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the exponents again. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nSo, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because in the first part, only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term contributes, and in the second part, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes. So, when multiplied together, the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), with coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been written differently, such as \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's not the case here.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion is 20.

So, when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(c\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

It's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the expression, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Since the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would indeed give 6 * 64 = 384.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for. So, that means I need to calculate two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0 because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\).

Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the term from each part of the product. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply each by \\(a^2b^2\\), then sum them up? But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it would just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times the power of \\(c\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), I need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m \\times \\text{coefficient})\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, and any term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^m\\) term would be a term in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expression and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) really 64? Let me think: when \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, yes, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, correct. So, 6 * 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term.

Because if the exponent of \\(c\\) is not zero, then the term would be something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because only when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., when the power of \\(c\\) is zero) will the term be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me break it down:\n\n1. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I found earlier, that's 6.\n\n2. Next, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term.

Because if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6, but that seems too simple. But the way the problem is phrased, it's in the product of two expressions, so it's likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, but that would be if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But no, because the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it can only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part, but only the term in the second part with \\(c^0\\) will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them different terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(c^0\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering each step and verifying, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is the product of a term from each expansion. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then the \\(c\\) part must be such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just a constant. But actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), and doesn't involve any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and since we're looking for the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, we can sum all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, then in the second part, we can have any term, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But the problem is, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms from the second expression. Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient and the \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second part is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get different terms in the product. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in that expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient times the corresponding \\(c\\) term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can sum all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be the case if we were collecting like terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would require knowing the specific term. Wait, but the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought earlier, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a coefficient that's a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, maybe the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(c\\), but that's not specified. Hmm, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but we just want \\(a^2b^2\\), so the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we're supposed to treat it as a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other factor, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about how the product works. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms that are products of terms from \\(P\\) and terms from \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times Q(c)\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient; it's still a function of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. That would make the coefficient a numerical value, independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 multiplied by that coefficient. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, combining both parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then technically, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that sum is equal to \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and the problem is more likely asking for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that would give \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and similarly, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would be \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, but only when their variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Wait, but that's not the case here. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.

If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion will give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, each multiplied by 6. So, that's why I calculated the sum of coefficients in the second expansion as 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this because I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the middle term of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. Wait, but no, because in the problem, we're not looking for \\(c^0\\), we're looking for any term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not possible unless the second term is 1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if the second expansion contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so each coefficient from the second expansion adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought that perhaps I should only consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, but that would be if we were looking for a term like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it's only the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but now I'm getting two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m} \\times c^{n}\\), but actually, no, more accurately, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these, you get \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's correct. Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we're looking for any term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is anything, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, which suggests that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is expecting the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. So, perhaps I need to clarify the problem statement. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the second expansion contributes a \\(c^0\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the correct answer is 120. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. I think I was confused earlier because I considered all terms, but actually, only the term where the second polynomial contributes \\(c^0\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Because if we take any other term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it would have some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and then the entire expression would have those \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would come from the term where the \\(c\\) parts cancel out, leaving just a constant. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\).

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the first part, specifically the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might make more sense. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. But wait, that would give 6 * 64 = 384. But if I think of it as only the constant term in the second part, which is 20, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is correct? Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you write out the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that each term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) contributes to the coefficient, and each such term would have a different power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's 1 times (c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because when you expand, you have \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the second expansion has coefficients 1 and 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6*64=384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(64) = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (1*c + 1*(1/c)), but if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different. In that case, you would need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem just asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think it's 384.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Let me compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in the second part. So, the total coefficient would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, summing them gives 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum is 64. So, 6*64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe it's 120, but that was under the assumption that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which isn't the case here. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
