    "text": " Because if I'm multiplying the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term is independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give me a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) when you multiply them out. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which it shouldn't be. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually considering the product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that the \\(c\\) terms are considered separately, and the coefficient is just 6, as we found earlier, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a very large number, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) gives 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 when \\(c = 1\\).

But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by it. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term from the second part could be any term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the entire second part is multiplied by 1, so the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), which are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the corresponding terms from the second expansion must be constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, that makes sense. Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me just go through it again to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. So, step by step:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Then, consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Now, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

When you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that's how you find the sum of coefficients. So, if \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, since each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, I need to find two things: 1) the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2) the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering that the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, so yes, the coefficients multiply. Alternatively, if we consider that the two parts are independent, then the coefficient would indeed be the product of the individual coefficients. So, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^k \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - k}\\) or something like that, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times those coefficients. So, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and then see. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning it has terms with positive and negative exponents. But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct.

Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the coefficient is a constant. That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense. So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), effectively the constant term in \\(c\\). So, let's proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can treat this as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. So, first, we find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have that, we can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial.

So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Maybe I need to think differently. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute some other terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with a coefficient of 6, and since it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which has a total sum of 64, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems high, but maybe it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you take any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second polynomial, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that changes things. So, I was wrong earlier when I thought it's 6 * 64. Instead, it's 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which is incorrect because only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just contribute a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would just be multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate polynomial and find its sum of coefficients, then multiply by 6. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the answer is just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That seems correct, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). Therefore, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: The problem might be only considering the coefficient in the expansion, so perhaps I don't need to consider the entire sum. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's acceptable to ignore the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts and see, but that might be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, let's approach it differently. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) first, which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this another way. Suppose I consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply these two sums, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second sum, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second sum, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another thought: The problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion, which occurs when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j=3\\). Then, the coefficient from the second sum would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then the total coefficient would be 6*20=120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the second part. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that each term in the second expansion multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*2=2. But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, that seems contradictory. So, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but when you have variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6*20=120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), not 2. So, in that case, my approach of multiplying by the sum of coefficients is incorrect. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, when I expand the entire expression, each term is of the form \\(a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\\), where \\(i\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(j\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{1}{0}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 1*2=2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, that suggests that my approach is incorrect because the coefficient isn't just a constant but a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial, but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might mean the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, in which case it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's just the scalar coefficient multiplied by the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be the sum of all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is indeed 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. The coefficients from the second polynomial are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, summing them up: 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. So, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which might just be the scalar multiple, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's acceptable to consider the coefficient as the scalar 384, treating all the \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial, but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're looking for the coefficient as a scalar, treating all other variables as constants. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 384, as a scalar, multiplied by the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 384 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the entire expression \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which would be \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the scalar coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be the term without \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j=3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. But the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so I think it's expecting 384.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, maybe I should just go with 120 if it's considering only the constant term, but I think the problem is more likely expecting 384 because it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think that's unlikely. The problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is typically a scalar. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, so perhaps in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial as well. So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which simplifies to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting just the scalar coefficient, which is 120, the constant term. Hmm, I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the entire polynomial as the coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But that seems too long, and the problem might just be expecting the scalar coefficient, which would be 120 if considering only the constant term, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a scalar, multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\).

So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the \\(c\\) expansion, it would introduce some power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 120. So, I think that's correct.

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think that when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if we're only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they might be considering all variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are to be treated as constants or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I thought earlier. So, perhaps that's the answer. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not an expression. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if you multiply the two expressions, you might have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(k = 0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That makes more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I need to consider both parts: the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion.

Let me confirm that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have needed to consider that, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as that's the only way the term would exist in the product without any \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that term as a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, or perhaps we can just consider that the coefficient is multiplied by 1, but that might not be right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just be 1, right? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term independent of \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for the constant term is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just verify each step again. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct. I think I'm confident with that answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a factor that is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), thus the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just constants when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify that approach because I might be missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, as before, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm correct, but let me think again. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(1 * (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of coefficients when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2. So, yes, that approach works. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just write that down.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Problem:** We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the Binomial Theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second.

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense.

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.
