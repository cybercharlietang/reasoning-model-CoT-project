    "text": " Do I need to consider that part as well? Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part would contribute something else, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, maybe it's just 6. But wait, let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and those terms from the second expansion don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because each term in the second part just adds a multiple of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but those are different terms, not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you don't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but each of those will have their own coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you expand the entire expression, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot (1/c)\\), etc., each of these will be separate terms in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check another way. Let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. From \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\\). But I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so \\(i = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each term in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the term in the second expansion where \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which implies \\(j = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, I think I was confused earlier because I was considering all the terms, but actually, only the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe it doesn't because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part? Wait, but I think I might be missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to that. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is a constant with respect to \\(c\\)) by the constant term in the second expansion. But wait, does the second expansion have a constant term? Let me check. The exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). For this to be zero (i.e., a constant term), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) by the constant term 20, I get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the terms where the product doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. So, only the constant term in the second expansion (which is 20) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let's recalculate the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or do they? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. Wait, no, because when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in the product, you have to consider all possible ways that term can be formed by multiplying terms from each part. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the terms from the second part would be multiplied by each term from the first part.

But wait, no, that's not correct either because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just a constant factor. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as the product of two separate expansions. So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term from the first expansion, and when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would only be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, first, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, I need to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, if the second polynomial is expanded, it's a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\) with coefficients. The sum of all coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check another approach.

But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but only the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's proceed step by step. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, I'll use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when we multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to take the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm interpreting it correctly, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but actually, the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product of two independent variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because it's a single term with specific exponents for all variables. Therefore, my previous calculation of 120 should be correct. Let me just go through it again to make sure. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand that part as well or if it's just there as a multiplier. Wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect that term. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how the second part contributes. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and then, since the second part is being multiplied, it might just be that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, I think I need to consider how the second part affects the coefficient. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that also doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). For this exponent to be zero, we have \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the only term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, from earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with various exponents of \\(c\\), but only the term when \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product and see how the terms combine. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second part. So, yeah, that term is 20, and so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand that part as well or if it's somehow related to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients should be independent. Hmm, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in that expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and each term in the product will have a combination of \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{m - (6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial \\((a + b)^4\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the entire expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because when you multiply by each term in the second polynomial, you're not adding anything to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term except scaling it by each coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only term that would contribute to a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To get \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Or is there a part where the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and the second part would contribute terms involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then include terms with \\(c\\). But that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so the coefficient would have to be a number, not an expression with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all the terms, but only for the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expansion. Wait, but that still doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, so its coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not how it works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, and the variables are multiplied together. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient isn't just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check: the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, which would include terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, so I'm probably missing something. Let me try to think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand both parts separately first. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from the first part, and the second part would contribute a factor that's multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually numbers. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me try that approach. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. From earlier, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both expansions, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm treating the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term, but actually, each term in that expansion is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and consider the coefficients accordingly. Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and not in the second part, which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would mean the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(c^m(1/c)^n\\) where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and in the second part, any term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, it's asking for the coefficient when you consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Let's consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but actually, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, the coefficient becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But no, because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but I don't think so because the product includes the second expansion, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check with a simpler example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in this product would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * 2 = 4. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to check out. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in our case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because any term from the second polynomial will have some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different, because then we would have to find the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe they don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part? Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two expressions. So, does that mean I have to consider the entire expansion, including the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it just about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part? Hmm, maybe I need to consider all possible terms in the product and find the ones where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and wants the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Wait, but the original problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over the products of the coefficients from both expansions. Let me try to formalize this. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is being multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a sum involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the second part is given, so perhaps it's more involved. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first sum (which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)) multiplied by the entire second sum. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\right)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me try that approach. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to consider the terms in the first expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, we need the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that gives \\(c^0\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Wait, that makes sense because we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Let me double-check that. In the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6, but given the structure of the problem, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we also need the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first sum when \\(k = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, when you multiply this by each term in the second sum, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms will have a factor of \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion? Because each time you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion, you get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different \\(c\\) exponents. But wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that feels off because the variables are different. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms.

Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me verify this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in that case, yes, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, but when you multiply, you have to consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then all the terms from the second expansion will just be multiplied by 1 when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded, and each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then any term from the second expansion will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I should think that since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, then each term in the second expansion will multiply this 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the first expansion, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively), then that would be different. But as the problem is stated, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider if any cross terms affect the coefficient, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, I think that reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me double-check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. And the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the final answer should be 384. Wait, but just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, maybe the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), considering the entire expression. Because if that's the case, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by some term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That would make sense because the entire term would be \\(6 \\times \\text{constant term}\\). Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, if I multiply this by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's the right approach. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Hmm, so maybe I was overcomplicating it. If the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6, because the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) and its powers, which don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems contradictory because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would actually be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right either because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in each term of the product, but each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, maybe it's just 6, as the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as part of the term, so maybe it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), so it's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems too high. But actually, each term in the product would have a coefficient, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term has a specific power of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in all terms, each multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 384. But maybe I should check the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require the second factor to contribute a constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the first case, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safer to assume that it's 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. But since it's not specifying \\(c\\), maybe it's 384. Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me see if I can find similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two polynomials, unless specified otherwise, it's considering the coefficient irrespective of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with both positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, if the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer 120, considering only the constant term. Hmm. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I just did a quick calculation and realized that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with specific coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's the correct approach.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, which is 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think I'm confident now that the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 2 * (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial). In this case, the second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be zero. But in the original problem, the second polynomial does have a \\(c^0\\) term, which is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, depending on whether the problem wants the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically with \\(c^0\\), the answer would be different. Since the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's safer to assume that it's asking for the coefficient irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But given the problem statement, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, I just thought of another way. Maybe the problem is actually considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, because the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficients do combine. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think of a different example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120, but if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. Since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's 384. But I'm still a bit uncertain because sometimes problems like this assume that you're considering the term with the same variables, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so I think it's correct to say that the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute it another way. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product. Each term in the product is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has coefficient 6, and multiply it by each term from the second part, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm supposed to consider other terms. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when I expand it, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the first polynomial has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if there were terms in \\(c\\) that could somehow affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but since they're separate variables, they don't interfere. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term in the second expansion, which does involve \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).

Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Let me work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients from each part? Hmm, actually, yes, because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and a term \\(20c^0\\) from the second expansion, multiplying them gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\).

Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant coefficient. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the term that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

But that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part? Or is it that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? That seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is separate, so the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by some expression in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is written as a single expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me think. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the middle term of the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, but rather a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is separate, so the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression is a product. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from \\(k = 2\\), as before, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that means the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems odd because the expression includes \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) as 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something else? Wait, no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the second expansion as a scalar multiplier. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let's try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems more accurate. So, let me work on the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384 if we considered the sum of all coefficients, but that was under a different interpretation of the problem. Now, considering that the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer would be 120. Let me double-check that reasoning. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term from the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is when \\(k = 3\\), giving us 20. So, the combined term is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's intended to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because the problem is asking for a specific term. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just confirm with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). If I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, in this case, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because there's no \\(b\\) in the second part. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat the second expansion as a constant. But that doesn't make much sense because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I think that's the correct interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm not sure if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe it's just multiplying the two expressions together, so the coefficients would multiply as well. Let me think. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), so when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be a different term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiplying it by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the terms would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but that would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, maybe the problem is only about the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would still be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms at all. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require multiplying by the corresponding terms from the \\(c\\) expansion, but that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check that. So, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, to find that, I would take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. But let me check if the problem is indeed asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but since \\(c\\) is involved, maybe it's considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so when we pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, we have to consider all possible terms from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but actually, no. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Wait, but I feel like that might not be correct because maybe each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to different terms in the product, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and each of those would be a separate term in the product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients would multiply. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient for each term in the second expansion is some number, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both expressions fully, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and each term in the second expansion would contribute their coefficients, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 * 64 = 384.
