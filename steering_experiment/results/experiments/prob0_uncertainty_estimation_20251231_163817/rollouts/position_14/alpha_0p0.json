Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a product of two polynomials. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term interacts with the terms from the other expansion. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. Let me think: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part can be any term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify more constraints, but in this case, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that's the way to go. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion's terms might affect the coefficient, but I don't think so because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, I think the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion (64), giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part of the product. The second part involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but actually, each term in the product will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will accumulate all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of the coefficients in the second part really 64? Let me think again. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes 1, and the sum is indeed \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would be correct. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can just take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the entire second part evaluated at whatever terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there something else I'm missing? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms from the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the constant term is 20, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems plausible. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the entire expression, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Then, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems to make sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times each of these coefficients. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Because if \\(c\\) is set to 1, then the entire expression is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But the problem didn't specify setting \\(c = 1\\), so maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But again, I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants because it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. As I calculated earlier, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, let me try to see if 120 makes sense. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term of 20, so the product would have a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is 120 \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is what the problem is asking for. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute both possibilities. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. On the other hand, if I only consider the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient is 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because each term in the second expansion is a constant coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply that by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\cdot 6c^4\\), etc. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion's coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, the sum of those coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the answer would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion). As I calculated before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But since the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's the former, 384. Let me verify this. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(64\\) when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

So, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by anything else, it would change the variables, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term by setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero, which gave me \\(m = 3\\) and the coefficient 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well or if it affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) in it, then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which is not what we want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by the 6 from the first part to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first will be multiplied by the constant term from the second, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the answer. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. There's no other combination because any term from the second part that has a \\(c\\) would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, yeah, I think 120 is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, maybe the entire expression is multiplied together, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 1, because the other part doesn't contribute anything to \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check that again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient much larger. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem correct either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a, b, c\\) all in the same expression, but I don't think that's the case here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, let me compute that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems more likely, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion. Wait, but that's the same as before, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, maybe that's the correct answer. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes both parts, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider all possible terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Let me verify that approach. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the coefficient of that term times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a, b, c\\) all in the same expression, but that's not the case here. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so they are separate. So, when you expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But given the way the problem is phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with a coefficient equal to 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify that, so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a, b, c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case. The expression is a product of two separate expressions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a, b, c\\) all in the same expression, but that's not the case here. So, given that, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because that's the term where \\(c^3\\) and \\(c^{-3}\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that we're considering all possible terms in the product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) part, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the entire expansion to check. Let me try that. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 6a^2b^2c^2, 6a^2b^2, 6a^2b^2c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 * 20 = 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about it differently. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by every term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part, so maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might need to consider how many ways this term can be formed when multiplying by the second expression. Wait, but actually, the variables in the second expression are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would have factors from both expressions. So, for example, a term might be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^3\\), or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^2\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that any term where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) part? Hmm, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe we can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the other part). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because for each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), you multiply by every term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the entire expression, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expression. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 2^6 = 64, as I calculated earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me check this again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these problems. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in the second expression is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire expansion, it would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i}a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so only when \\(i = 2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\). So, that's 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) for j=0 to 6), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand that as well or if it's just a separate part. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the entire expansion of the second part just gets multiplied by 1, so the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're just multiplying it by some constant. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply the entire expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\), which is 20. When you multiply these together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second binomial, which is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to a constant, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would multiply to give \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. That makes more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider all terms in the second part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me proceed with that approach. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, does the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product actually get multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it only the constant term? Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part would contribute all possible powers, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, now I'm confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). That means, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a constant. So, perhaps the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, my earlier approach was correct: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. Alternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but that seems off because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so maybe I'm supposed to consider all the terms and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would just be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. That would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and consider all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would imply summing over all possible coefficients, which isn't standard. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't a numerical coefficient. So, I think my approach is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check the steps. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). 3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).

Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part.

So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable. So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's in the product of two expressions. So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't give a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.

So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Because when you multiply the two expansions, any term from the first expansion will be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, if I want a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and nothing else, that would be the term where the first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second part contributes \\(c^0\\). So, yes, I think that's right. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Because when you multiply the terms, the coefficients multiply.

Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check that. Is the constant term actually 20? Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Yeah, 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 20 is correct. And 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire product, but I think my initial approach is correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so only the constant term from the second expansion would affect it. If I had to find a term that includes \\(c\\), then I would have to consider cross terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), only the constant term would contribute.

Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient will be multiplied by that constant. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product where the second part is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0 = 1\\) when \\(k = 0\\). Wait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the expansion of that will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). But when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, the \\(c\\) terms would still be present. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of the terms from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the second part? Or do I need to consider how the second part affects it? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't change that. Wait, but let me check that again. Suppose I write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiple times, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which typically refers to the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and it's the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, perhaps I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, I need to find the constant term in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. Let me confirm that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) stands alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part? Or is it more complicated? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term than \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by a term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, I might have thought it's just 6, but that would be incorrect because the entire product includes the \\(c\\) terms, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect that coefficient? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

So, when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these out, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's only present in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But that seems too straightforward. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, if there is one. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times 6, which is 120. Wait, no, hold on. I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That means the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But actually, that's not possible because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the case where the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), that is, 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0 = 1\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any power of \\(c\\), but I think that's not the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion is of the form (term from first part) \u00d7 (term from second part). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because any term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I was right the first time. To get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, and the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 \u00d7 64, that would be 384, which seems too high. But that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. Therefore, I think my initial approach was correct: to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. Let me check this again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are independent. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To get \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but maybe. Wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which are variables in the first part. The second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless \\(c\\) is related to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the terms in the second part don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) will just tag along as coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we need to consider the entire coefficient, including the part from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, it would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit confusing because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion. Let me think differently. Maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all those possibilities. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Hmm, that seems too simple. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms are independent. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient for each such term would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, but it's a separate variable, so the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that seems more plausible. Let me think: when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is another expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient is just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire product is a single expression, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. Let's denote \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(X \\times Y\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(Y\\), it becomes 6Y. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(Y\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(Y\\). But the problem doesn't specify a \\(c\\) term, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Y\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(Y(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me check with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't a single term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: when you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expression, so when multiplied by the second expression, which has terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is just 6. Wait, that seems more likely. Let me check online for similar problems. Hmm, I can't actually do that, but from what I remember, when variables are independent, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times something else, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me think: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated earlier, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where in the first part we have \\(a^2b^2\\) and in the second part, any term, because multiplying by any term in the second expression will just add the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or does it? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, so it's just the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term's coefficient, and then adding all those up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). So, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But no, the coefficient is just 6 because the other terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check another way. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), which confirms what I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
