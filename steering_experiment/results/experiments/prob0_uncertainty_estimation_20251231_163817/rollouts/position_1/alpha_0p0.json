    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables in the second part won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will remain 2 each. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. Let's denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). \n\nSince \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\) are polynomials in different variables, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, any term in \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from \\(P(a, b)\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all the terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. Since each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is a large number. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's equivalent to taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), because every term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, I think I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. \n\nWait, but in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), each term is of the form \\(\\text{(term from P)} \\times \\text{(term from Q)}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P will be multiplied by each term in Q, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q(c). \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense as a single coefficient. \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q(c). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute Q(1). \n\nQ(c) = \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, Q(1) = \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is 64. Hence, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, when I multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), and then set \\(c = 1\\), I get P(a, b) * 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut is that the correct interpretation? Alternatively, maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6. \n\nLet me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's asking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm confused now because the problem statement is ambiguous. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient when combining both parts. \n\nBut in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the question is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me think about how the product works. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\text{term from first polynomial} \\times \\text{term from second polynomial}\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if there's another way to interpret it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's either for a specific term or considering all terms with that part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should specify a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Without that, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think this is more likely because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context where \\(c\\) is a variable that's being summed over, but that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut again, that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense of the entire expression, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for a coefficient, it's a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I need to decide which interpretation is correct. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut to confirm, let's think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient. \n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if it's asking for the constant term. But given that the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), I think 384 is more appropriate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would indeed be 384. \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with combinatorics, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so solving that gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or does it mean I need to find the coefficient considering all parts?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the other part is about \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand the entire expression, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because they're multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, and I just need to consider the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from the \\(c\\) part. So, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms come from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would involve all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can come up is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, but is there a constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nLet me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. Because each term is of the form \\(c^{k} \\times (1/c)^{6 - k} = c^{2k - 6}\\). So, when \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^{-6}\\), \\(k = 1\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), up to \\(k = 6\\), \\(c^{6}\\).\n\nWait, so the exponents go from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2. Therefore, there is no constant term because 0 isn't achieved. The exponents are all even numbers from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\), but 0 is even, but let's see: when does \\(2k - 6 = 0\\)? Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, yes, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is 0, so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c)^k\\), but those would have exponents of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, but maybe it's only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit ambiguous.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify the problem. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 (c + 1/c)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\), which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nWhen we have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term.\n\nIn this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm considering only the constant term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the term from the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial is any term, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial, you get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the second term is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears as a standalone term is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\). But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be 0. Therefore, \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I should consider all terms, but now it's clear that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Yes, 6 choose 3 is 20, because 6!/(3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I think I can handle it.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression separately and then multiply them together.\n\nThe expression has two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means I can focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and then maybe the other part doesn't affect this term because it's multiplied by something involving \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, I need to make sure whether \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by some term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe it's just the product of the specific terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, actually, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which is the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe I can split this problem into two parts: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nLet me start with the first part: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). Calculating the combination, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m}\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because I want \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating the combination, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients I just found. That would be \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. When I multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 1. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't think I missed anything. The key was realizing that to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I needed the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion, and then multiplied the coefficients together.

But that doesn't quite make sense because the second part is also a polynomial, and when multiplied, it might affect the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), they are independent variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part's expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes considering all possible terms from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break down the problem into smaller parts. The expression is a product of two binomial expansions: one is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion of the second binomial. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, no. The terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply out the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be treated as a constant for the purpose of finding this specific term. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe I can proceed.\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to the case where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me verify that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, since the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I need to consider all possible terms that result from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion. But wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first and a term from the second. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a sum involving terms with \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient might be a function of \\(c\\).

But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then depend on \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the second part is separate. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems like a very long expression.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be an expression involving \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term, they're looking for a numerical coefficient, not one that's a function of other variables. So perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a numerical value, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we have to consider the entire expansion.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the product includes terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific term in the second expansion, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit strange because the problem might be expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. That would be a more typical problem. So, maybe I should proceed under that assumption.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I calculated earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm wrong. Let me check again.\n\nIf the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem probably expects a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is a numerical value, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the combined term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that wouldn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be an infinite series, but that's not the case here because the second expansion is finite.\n\nWait, no, because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has finite terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, each term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all terms \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But that sum would be \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\), because the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n=6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then we only consider the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), as before, and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical answer, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term, which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the rest is a separate part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two sums together, each term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before, with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems very high, and I'm not sure if that's what's intended.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I'm inclined to think that it's expecting the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But that seems too large, and perhaps the problem intended to ask for the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. But that seems unusual because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Given that, I think that's the more likely intended answer.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify, but usually in such problems, unless specified, they might be asking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120.\n\nGiven that, and considering that the problem might be expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check once more. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. That seems more reasonable.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the binomial coefficients from both parts of the expression. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's apply the binomial theorem here.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does the second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nActually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should just be a number, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and they just want the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, but in the product, it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. That might make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as the only variables and ignoring \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right either because \\(c\\) is part of the expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that it's a product of two separate expressions, so when you multiply them, the variables \\(a, b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expression, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that can't be because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that appears in the expansion, but multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's without any other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems high.\n\nWait, but that approach might not be correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by each term in the second expansion, not the sum of all coefficients. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, treating all variables as separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the expansion, but multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, as that's the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is just a multiplier that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just there to confuse me. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the other part, which is 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for an example. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a number but a polynomial. So, perhaps in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which we found earlier to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I'm assuming that it's considering the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving a final coefficient of 120.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem to be 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two different variables here, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and also \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can focus just on the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and not worry too much about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. The entire expression is multiplied together, so maybe I should consider both parts. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I might only need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because if I'm looking for a term that doesn't have \\(c\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well, right? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that term, it will give me \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I think I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nLet me start with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which states that:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay, so I need to expand this expression and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSince we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nMultiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expanded \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiplied these coefficients together to get 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients together:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find that specific term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(2\\). Perfect, that's the term I need. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does the part with \\(c\\) affect this coefficient? Hmm, maybe not directly because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately from the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too high. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product is when it's multiplied by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you would get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. \n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but in this case, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the binomial coefficients again. \n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, but this time with \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\).\n\nSo, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n\\[\n= \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the exponents of \\(c\\) will vary depending on \\(k\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider how these two expansions interact.\n\nWait a second, actually, in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, these two parts are multiplied together, but they involve different variables. That is, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. When we multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for instance, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) is a different variable. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will only come from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term? Let's check. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). For the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero (i.e., a constant term), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The second expansion has multiple terms, but only the constant term will not introduce any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors, so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it will result in a term that's \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion will have powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), they will produce terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Therefore, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me focus on the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). \n\nSo, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(c\\) terms might affect the overall coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a specific term.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So perhaps I need to consider all the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term) gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the term that's \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is in the product of both expansions. So, perhaps the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just from the first part, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from both parts when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, as I thought before, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm the calculations again. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms in this expansion will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\cdot b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how multiplying these two expressions affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product terms won't mix \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is a sum, not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if there's any \\(c\\) term, then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), you won't get just \\(a^2b^2\\), but something else.\n\nSo, I think that's the right approach. So, I need to find two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier as 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nAlright, so first, I already know the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\cdot (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, checking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6. That's correct.\n\nNext, checking the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\nWe found \\(k = 3\\) gives the term with \\(c^0\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct too.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that should be the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply by the entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's why we only take the constant term's coefficient, which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Calculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, let me check that again because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables' exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, the variables are separate. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I didn't consider this. What if I thought that the entire expression's expansion would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m (1/c)^n\\), but since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(m = n\\), which would mean \\(c^{m - n} = c^0\\). So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is when \\(m = n\\), which would be when \\(m + n = 6\\) because the second expansion is to the 6th power. Wait, no, that's not correct because in the expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to get \\(c^0\\), as I did before, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so when you multiply these two, you get 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there another way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be formed? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but those \\(c\\) terms somehow combine to give a term without \\(c\\)? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expansion, and the second expansion only contributes \\(c\\) terms or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion and see if that's the case. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\). Among all these terms, the only one that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is the one multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, that term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that since the two polynomials are multiplied together, and \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems straightforward.\n\nI don't think I'm missing anything here. The key insight is recognizing that to get a term without \\(c\\), you have to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion, and that the coefficients multiply when you're looking for the term that combines both parts. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is also squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables or terms. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q(c)\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). Because any other term in \\(Q(c)\\) would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term is 20, so 6*20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because only the constant term would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. The other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would add powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6*20=120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, maybe I can consider the entire expansion. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2 \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is 20, as I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 \\times 20 + 6a^2b^2/c^2 + 6a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6.\n\nSo, the term 6a^2b^2 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 6a^2b^2 multiplied by 20, which gives 120a^2b^2. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me check the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, as I did before, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) to get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit rusty on my combinatorics, but I think I can work through it.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), so the expansion would be from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(k = 4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write out the general term for the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But wait, the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the terms in the first expansion don't interact with the terms in the second expansion in a way that would change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way this term would contribute is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), every term involves either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), except when the exponents cancel out.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the second expansion, each term is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so unless \\(k = 0\\), which isn't possible here because the exponents are 6. Wait, no, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with some coefficient.\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that could happen is if the second factor contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nWait, but in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is there a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0? Let me check.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expansion that affects this is the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems right, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the entire expansion as a product and see if any other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) wouldn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) and 20 from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is (4 * 3)/(2 * 1) = 6, which is correct.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is (6 * 5 * 4)/(3 * 2 * 1) = 20, which is also correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by expanding both parts and looking for the term, but that seems unnecessary since the variables are separate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product and see how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting used to these kinds of problems, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{1} = 4, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{3} = 4, \\quad \\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that takes care of the first part. Now, the expression I'm given is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait a minute, but in the original problem, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because in the multiplication, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient, maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - (6 - m)} = a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k=2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient here is 6, as we saw earlier.\n\nNow, when we multiply this term by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each such term would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part is just a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), their coefficients would add up as the sum of the coefficients from the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my reasoning. Another way to think about it is: when you expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but in reality, each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the specific term where \\(6 - 2m = k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me make sure that this is correct by another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of its coefficients is.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}, \\dbinom{6}{1}, \\dbinom{6}{2}, \\ldots, \\dbinom{6}{6}\\), which are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: is there any possibility that I'm misapplying the binomial theorem here? For example, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get up to \\(b^4\\), and when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), then all the terms in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients add up.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I had to compute the entire expansion, I would have:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\n\\]\n\nBut when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes \\(6 \\times\\) its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us the expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). \n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find that term, I can set \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by that coefficient. \n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term from the second expansion will just be a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the second expansion is separate, so when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we just need to consider the constant term from the second expansion. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\), then it's not just \\(a^2b^2\\) anymore\u2014it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the \\(c\\) terms should not be present. Therefore, we need to find the constant term in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me think about that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this expansion will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the constant term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). \n\nWait, let me make sure. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded and then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all products where the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is any term. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, it would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. Therefore, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms are canceled out. So, the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms could affect the coefficient if we're considering the entire expression, but in this case, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and only consider the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let's think about the expansion. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which is when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving 20.\n\nSo, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients can add up in certain ways, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), each term in the product will have a unique combination of exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the constant term in the second part is 0 because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 0 = 0. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nWait, but in that case, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^3b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{3}{3} = 1\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * 3 = 3. Let me check: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^3 = c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^3c^3\\), \\(3a^3c\\), \\(3a^3/c\\), \\(a^3/c^3\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^3\\) is 3, which matches 1 * 3. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Since the variables are independent, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, but when multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). For example, if I have a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^k\\) and another term that's \\(c^{-k}\\), their product would be \\(c^0 = 1\\), so maybe I need to consider all such pairs. But no, because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is either \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), or \\(c^{-6}\\). So, to get a constant term, you can only multiply a term with \\(c^k\\) by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), but in the expansion, each term is already a single power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^4\\) is \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. The only term that remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). This term corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. Okay, so that's the first part. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. \n\nWait, but hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is a separate binomial expansion. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the product \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that can't be right because the second polynomial is not a constant.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for all terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to sum the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, the coefficient in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears with any power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions.\n\nWait, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so it's a polynomial, not a number. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a number but a polynomial.\n\nBut in the given problem, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that it's expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we would need to find the term in the second expansion where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nSo, let's explore that possibility. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's ambiguous. However, given that the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or it might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would make it a polynomial, not a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a number, so it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to be sure, let's think about how the problem is structured. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), we have a term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), this would be 6 * (sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\)).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\), then we need to find \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but it's common in such problems to ask for the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations:\n\n1. If the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n2. If it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended answer is 120, as it's more likely that they want the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nBut to make sure, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it should specify the power of \\(c\\). But given the ambiguity, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after considering both interpretations, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). If I apply the binomial theorem here, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.

I need to consider the entire product.\n\nNow, let me look at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and how it interacts with each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, hold on. The entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut looking at the second expansion, it's all in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms in the second expansion don't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in them. That means, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, each of these products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. Because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, in other words, the only term in the second expansion that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product will consist of terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\).\n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, hold on. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., as well as \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But that would mean adding up all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be the entire sum from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When we have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product would be combinations of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. But in reality, in the product, each term is a unique combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we have to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1, so the coefficient is just a number. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nFrom the first expansion, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, but that would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which seems too large. But I think that's incorrect because each term in the product is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the original problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nI think the key here is that the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, so when we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, in the product, each term is a unique combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., as well as \\(20a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Because if it were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would imply summing all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the same as multiplying the entire second expansion by 6, leading to a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them:\n\\[\na^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nIf I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. But if I ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 0 because there's no term with \\(a^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, if I ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c\\)) = 2. But in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial.\n\nBut in the original problem, the variables are separate, so I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, considering all powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify to consider all powers of \\(c\\). It just said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, I think it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But as it stands, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the problem, I see two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since my target term doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about that part? Or do I?\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can ignore the second part because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Let me think about that.\n\nIf I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then consider the entire second part as a constant factor? Or is that not correct?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, let me clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the case where \\(k = 2\\) in the first part and any \\(m\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because for each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\), etc., each with different exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present in the product unless the second part also has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part as well.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I can solve this problem by finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it again.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term without any \\(c\\), we need to multiply by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to check: if I consider the entire expansion, each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. But in the original problem, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless we have a \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, unless we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that might not make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist in the product unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been just \\((a + b)^4\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 7 terms (from \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\)), each term in the product will have different powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients are considered in the entire expression, but here, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\) that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of it another way. Suppose I expand both expressions separately and then multiply them. The first expansion has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The second expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is one term, \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times 1/c\\) is another, etc., down to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product's expansion and see if \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. But since the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nThe term where \\(k = 2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of specific terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me recall that in the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait a second, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the second part, we have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Is that right?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\nOkay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply the constant term in the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nIs there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. If I take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would have a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term from the second part contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
