    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding what the problem is asking. \n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which involves combinations. Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomials, so when you multiply them out, the terms will involve both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider all terms in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. However, since \\(c\\) is involved in the other part, I might need to see how the \\(c\\) terms interact. But hold on, the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me clarify that.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by various terms from the second part, each involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but it's being multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that perhaps we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, but only focusing on the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that might not be correct because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's coefficients contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiple times, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, since this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be incorrect because the second part's coefficients are not just summed; each term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by 64.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, first, let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up when combining like terms, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so each of those terms would have their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\) are different terms. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part, as I thought earlier. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first factor, and in the second factor, we have terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second factor because each term in the second factor is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second factor is a separate term with its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by each coefficient in the second factor, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each factor. So, if I denote the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor as \\(C_1\\) and the sum of the coefficients in the second factor as \\(C_2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(C_1 \\times C_2\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second factor is indeed 64, as we found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(C_1 = 6\\) and \\(C_2 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(C_1 \\times C_2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), that would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach works.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this manually.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nNow, multiplying these together:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, the terms don't have \\(a^2b^2\\) because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first part is 1 each. Wait, so maybe my initial approach doesn't apply here. Hmm, perhaps my example isn't the best because in the original problem, the exponents are higher.\n\nLet me try another example where the exponents are higher.\n\nConsider \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding this:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in this product, there's no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second expansion, the terms are combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(c\\). Wait, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2\\), which only has up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. But according to my earlier approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}\\) is 1 for \\(a^0b^2\\), but we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, but since the exponent is 2, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), but the term would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}a^0b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient in the product would be zero times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6, so zero. Which matches the manual calculation.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because it's not present in the first expansion. So, my approach seems to hold here.\n\nAnother example: Let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n\\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\(a^3c + a^3/c + 3a^2bc + 3a^2b/c + 3ab^2c + 3ab^2/c + b^3c + b^3/c\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in this product, the terms are \\(a^3c\\), \\(a^3/c\\), \\(3a^2bc\\), \\(3a^2b/c\\), \\(3ab^2c\\), \\(3ab^2/c\\), \\(b^3c\\), \\(b^3/c\\). So, there's no term with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is zero. According to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{3}{2} = 3\\), but wait, no, because in \\((a + b)^3\\), the term \\(a^2b\\) is present, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require the exponent to be 4, which is higher than 3. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the terms go up to \\(a^3\\) and \\(b^3\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(a^2b^2\\) which is degree 4, but the expansion only goes up to degree 3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^3\\) is zero, which matches the manual calculation. So, the coefficient in the product would be zero times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so zero.\n\nWait, but in my initial problem, the exponent on \\((a + b)\\) is 4, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is present because 2 + 2 = 4. So, that term exists, and the coefficient is 6. Then, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me try another example where the coefficient should be non-zero.\n\nConsider \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\nEach term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(12a^2b^2\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\).\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 12, because that's the coefficient from the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 2\\).\n\nAccording to my approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, 6 * 4 = 24. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 12, not 24. Hmm, so my approach seems to be giving the wrong answer here. That means I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 12, but according to my earlier method, it's 6 * 4 = 24. So, that's incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach is flawed.\n\nWait, so what's the correct way to compute it?\n\nIn the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 12, which comes from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 2\\). So, it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term (2) in the second part. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has a constant term. Let me check what that constant term is.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, in the example I just did, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), but wait, in that case, the exponent was 2, so general term is \\(\\dbinom{2}{k}c^{2 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{2}{k}c^{2 - 2k}\\). So, constant term when \\(2 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 1\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), which matches the example.\n\nSo, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 2 = 12, which is correct. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part, not the sum of all coefficients.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term of 20. So, if I follow this approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, in the example, that's correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 12, which is 6 * 2. So, in the original problem, it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the sum of the coefficients in the second part was 64, but that seems to have led me astray. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second part because only the constant term will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nWait, but in the example, when I multiplied \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 12, which came from 6 * 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second part. So, that seems to align with this approach.\n\nBut then, in the original problem, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand this product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., as well as the constant term 20. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64. But wait, no, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by each coefficient from the second part, but that would lead to multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part. But that seems more complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would only happen if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut in my earlier example, when I took \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 12, which is 6 * 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second expansion. So, that seems to support this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 12, which is 6 * 2, not 6 * 4 = 24. So, perhaps the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part, not the sum of all coefficients. Therefore, in the original problem, it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut then, why in the example, when I expanded \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 12, which is 6 * 2, the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another example. Let's take \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\).\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c\\) and \\(6a^2b^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which would be 6 * 0 (since the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is zero). So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but in this case, the constant term in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is zero, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero, which matches the manual calculation.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and multiply it by the constant term in the second part. So, in the original problem, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, in the earlier example where I took \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was 12, which is 6 * 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second part. So, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems to be incorrect because in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier, and the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part.\n\nTherefore, to solve the original problem correctly, I should:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two results: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the original problem, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, if we're considering the entire product, then \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficients from each part that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and each term in the second part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my example, when I took \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product was 12, which is 6 * 2, where 2 is the constant term. So, that suggests that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part.\n\nBut I'm confused now because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^"

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write out each term.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficients will come from the binomial coefficients. So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating those coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider that part as well.\n\nNow, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, since \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{-k}\\), so each term becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in this second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), all the terms are in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and we need to find the total coefficient?\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since it's a separate variable, the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the expansion will be of the form (some coefficient) \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum all those coefficients.\n\nBut wait, but in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we saw earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). Similarly, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with coefficient 6. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), so the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), perhaps it's different.\n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, that coefficient contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's think about it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). So, each of these terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6, and they all contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by 6a^2b^2, gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), each contributing 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c\\) term. So, adding all those together gives 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) actually 64? Let me calculate it manually.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), term is \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), term is \\(6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), term is \\(15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), term is \\(15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), term is \\(6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\), term is \\(c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, +15 = 22, +20 = 42, +15 = 57, +6 = 63, +1 = 64. Yes, that checks out. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) can be any even integer from -6 to 6. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking for all terms where \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=2\\), regardless of \\(n\\). So, each such term will have a coefficient of 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient from the second part. But since the second part has terms with coefficients 1, 6, 15, 20, etc., each of these will be multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient is 6*(sum of all coefficients in the second part) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, like \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, because when \\(k=3\\), the term is \\(20c^0\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20 = 120? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, it's 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we sum all coefficients in this part by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together, one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then combine them somehow.\n\nFirst, I think I should expand each part separately using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so yes, that's the term. The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, looking at the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWait, but the original problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficients from the second part just multiply the coefficients from the first part? Or maybe since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be the case. So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part? But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that might not be correct because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that right?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product, so each term in the product is a combination of terms from both parts. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the question is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all those products where the \\(c\\) terms are whatever, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{m}\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part. So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm my earlier thought.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you might have to consider if the exponents add up in a certain way, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) being independent of \\(c\\), so it's just 6 times whatever the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second expansion. But wait, no, because the problem doesn't specify any conditions on \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\binom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (c + 1/c), but if we're just considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, that's not possible because \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but in this problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, maybe I was wrong earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so it's only formed when the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part.\n\nOh! That makes more sense. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nSo, let me correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I confused the requirement of the problem. The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, in the product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and we need a term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, my initial approach was wrong because I considered the sum of all coefficients, but actually, we need only the coefficient that results in the term without \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the right answer now. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should expand each part separately and then see how they combine. Maybe I can use the binomial theorem for both expansions. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so the first part contributes a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, what about the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I need to expand this as well. Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), and this part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? So, when we multiply the two expansions together, we're looking for the product of terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would just come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), would contribute a constant term, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the second part contributes a coefficient of 20 for the constant term. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives \\(20c^0 = 20\\). So, when multiplied together, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the first part, as the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple when multiplied by the first expansion. So, the entire expression is equivalent to 20 times \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 20 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, so 120. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be the sum over all terms from the first expansion multiplied by the sum over all terms from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the binomial coefficients again. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer should be \\boxed{120}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because there are two variables, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe I can separate the parts involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the parts involving \\(c\\)?\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which I can calculate.\n\nWait, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly interested in the terms involving \\(c\\), but since the entire expression is multiplied together, I need to consider whether the terms involving \\(c\\) will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will just add a factor that's multiplied by the 6 from the first part. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any term from the second expression. Wait, but the second expression has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by those, they become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part isn't a constant. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each of those coefficients. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because those terms would have \\(c\\) in them, making them different terms.\n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the key here is that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will be the same as \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have some power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero? Because none of the terms from the second expansion will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\), since they all have \\(c\\) in them.\n\nWait, that seems possible. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), then in the product, all the terms will have either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so there will be no term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and then when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), etc. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, but none of these are \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, there is no term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); all such terms come with some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit strange. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because then \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6, that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me do that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the coefficient was zero, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me check again.\n\nWhen I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of these terms gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the constant term \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, so my initial thought that it was zero was wrong because I didn't consider that the constant term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nLet me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense.

That would mean \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), right?\n\nSo, let me write that out. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Got that.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but in the second binomial, there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. It's only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by some constant from the second binomial?\n\nLet me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first binomial) multiplied by 20 (from the second binomial). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each step. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire expression. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables multiply as well. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first binomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first binomial and the constant term in the second binomial. So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, I think my answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two parts multiplied together: one with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I?\n\nWait, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions, so the terms from each part will multiply together. But I'm only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need to find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't matter? Or does it?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, no, actually, I think the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would accumulate all those products.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the terms from the second expansion have different powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, it's a different term. Wait, that makes more sense. So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only then would the term be \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, let me break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nOkay, starting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{k}b^{n - k}\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^k = a^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay. So, this is another binomial expansion. The general term in the expansion of \\((x + y)^m\\) is \\(\\dbinom{m}{k}x^{k}y^{m - k}\\). In this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = 1/c\\), and \\(m = 6\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k}c^{-(6 - k)} = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the two coefficients we found: 6 and 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I set up the general term as \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{k}(1/c)^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{2k - 6}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero gives \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{k}b^{4 - k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Maybe I should start by understanding what the problem is asking for. \n\nFirst, I know that when we expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Similarly, the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can also be expanded using the binomial theorem.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Once I find that coefficient, I might need to consider how it interacts with the other part of the expression involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I should tackle each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let's compute that coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nEach term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(6\\) down to \\(-6\\) in steps of 2. That means the exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating things by looking at the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Because when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in order to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first part.\n\nLet me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I wrote earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2(3)} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that all? Let me think again. Because when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{terms involving } c\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving different variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Then, I multiplied these two coefficients together because the terms \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) are multiplied together in the product, contributing to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but we're only interested in the part where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that approach is correct.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient would be the sum of \\(6\\) multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, that would give 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's the right approach because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different.\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering all terms, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}\\) = 6 * 1 = 6. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}\\) = 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms because they all have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term, but now I'm thinking that it's multiplied by all terms, which would give a larger coefficient. Which approach is correct?\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms would have different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of each corresponding term in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with my earlier thought where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\n\\]\n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a c\\) and \\(a (1/c)\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, and similarly for \\(b\\).\n\nSo, in this simple case, the approach works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, it's actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a polynomial in \\(c\\) as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider the entire product and see how \\(a^2b^2\\) appears.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term, and the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Let me try to check this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\n\\]\n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is \\(a^1b^0\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nBut in this case, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\n\\]\n\nIf I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(1 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1 + 1) = 3? Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficients in the second expansion are 1, 2, and 1, so the sum is 4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 4 = 4.\n\nBut in reality, when you multiply \\(a^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), and \\(a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, but if you consider all terms, the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 2 + 1) = 4. Wait, but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the coefficients and the terms. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the expansion of \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2c^2\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2 \\times 1\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^2 \\times 1/c^2\\) is 1 * 1 = 1. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), is 4.\n\nSimilarly, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product was 4, which is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion (which is 4). So, 1 * 4 = 4, which matches.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only include the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut in the simple example, when I considered \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which included both \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) was the sum of the coefficients of \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nWait, so perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier thought where I considered only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\). So, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, when I considered \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which included both \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\) was 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIn the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of all these terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, if that's the case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems high, but mathematically, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider \\(c\\) as a separate variable and only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 120.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, if that's the case, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, I think I need to resolve this confusion. Let me try to think about how the product expansion works.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\n"

    "text": " I'm a bit confused because the expression has two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Maybe I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, I know that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. \n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem to \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients in the second part don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other terms (with \\(c\\)) don't affect it. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, but since it's only in the first part, and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains as 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied as a whole.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial doesn't change because of the other polynomial unless there are cross terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power and involves \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not multiplied by other terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be the product of the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find all terms in \\(Q(c)\\) that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because only then would multiplying by them not introduce any \\(c\\) terms, allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as a term without \\(c\\). Wait, but that would only be the case if we're looking for a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\), but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, does that mean that the problem is considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or only the term where \\(c\\) is zero? I think I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, in the original problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. That seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would make sense, as then the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from some negative to positive numbers based on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some polynomial in \\(c\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, but that doesn't make sense either because \\(c\\) is a variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), with a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, is 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients is 64, but each term in the expansion is a coefficient multiplied by a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, it's not just 6 \u00d7 64.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply by 6, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is scaled by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 \u00d7 (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product only when multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all variables are considered, which would mean considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion in terms of \\(c\\), which is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient either.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is just a distraction or part of the problem that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that for each term in the product, if the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient is added. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But again, the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, and 120 is a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think about it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach because it's treating \\(c\\) as a variable and summing over all its coefficients, which might not be the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I found earlier.\n\nWait, let me check this again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c^0\\) is present, which would make the coefficient 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to think of it another way. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are the respective binomial coefficients. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing over all possible \\(m\\) such that the term includes \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must be misunderstanding something. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a constant, which would make the coefficient 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is misstated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which would be 120. That seems plausible because 120 is a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check online or recall similar problems. I think in problems like this, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's usually referring to the constant term with respect to that variable. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).

    "text": " Maybe I should start by looking at each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nI specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\) and I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2}\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Got that down.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This looks similar to the first binomial, but it's raised to the 6th power and involves \\(c\\) and its reciprocal. I suppose I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. So, each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(m\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nLet me simplify that term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for the product of the two expansions? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think that term won't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe I need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, because if I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, that will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless they cancel out, they would introduce \\(c\\) terms into the product, which we don't want since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion and then sum their contributions when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the product would involve terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or something, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient that's multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion, but that would include terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a multiple of some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning the constant term in the second expansion, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial expansion again. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when the exponent is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or only when the power of \\(c\\) is zero? Because if it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a whole and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.\n\nSo, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the second expansion isn't just a constant. The second expansion has multiple terms. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because it's not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to zero, making it a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the constant term in \\(c\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my reasoning again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all those coefficients. But that's not correct because each term has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, but that would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients multiplied by it.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually a product of two separate expansions, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the entire product would be \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, without specifying the power of \\(c\\), is ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any power of \\(c\\), which suggests that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again: it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But again, the problem is likely expecting a number, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if I were evaluating the product at \\(c = 1\\), but the problem isn't asking that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. So, the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems plausible.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Suppose I treat the entire product as a single expansion in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is 6\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, irrespective of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation again. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, when considering the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should focus on the part \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check that:\n\nIf \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression.\n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, actually, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be anything because they involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients from the other expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the other expansion, each term in the product will have a term from each expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will do, because they all involve \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. So, in this simpler case, it works.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part (which is 64), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\).\n3. Since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, its coefficient in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the product more directly.\n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables are independent, the coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients. But wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the product as a single polynomial, it would be a sum over all terms of the form \\(a^{i}b^{j}c^{k}\\), where \\(i + j = 4\\) and \\(k\\) ranges accordingly. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, again, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that 384 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) term and then multiplying it by the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " I remember that when you have expressions raised to a power, you can use the binomial theorem to expand them. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficients in this part don't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions, so I might need to consider all the terms when multiplied together. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, maybe the coefficients are independent. Let me think about that.\n\nSo, if I have two separate expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms will be like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or something. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by any term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in the first expansion, right? Because when you multiply by terms involving \\(c\\), they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply the entire expansion, you're considering all possible products. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it will have a \\(c\\) term, which would make the product have \\(c\\) in it, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\).\n\nSo, that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part.\n\nOkay, so let me calculate that. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem.\n\nThe general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because that's the constant term. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. I think I might have made a mistake in reasoning earlier. So, if I have two expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm multiplying them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by any term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second factor contributes a 1 (i.e., the constant term). So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a combination of terms, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion for that particular term. Since the first part gives 6 and the second part gives 20 when considering the constant term, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I don't think I made a mistake here. Let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is given by:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into smaller parts.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem.

Let me calculate the binomial coefficient there. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. So, that part I got.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, you're essentially taking every term from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part must contribute a term that doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) should be a single number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply everything out, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient for each such term would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for that specific \\(k\\). But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're considering all possible terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? That would mean that the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems a bit off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-6 - m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think about it properly.\n\nThe expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives terms with \\(c^l\\) where \\(l\\) can range from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\) in steps of 2, I think. Because each term in the expansion is a product of either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so each term is \\(c\\) raised to some power from \\(-6\\) to \\(6\\), but only even exponents, I believe.\n\nBut in any case, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. But then, when you multiply it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have a coefficient as well. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^l\\) would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^l\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 from the first part, and then I multiply it by each term from the second part, each term has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum of all those products, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 384. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different variables. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * (something). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. That way, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it might be 384, but that was when considering all possible coefficients from the second part, which would give a coefficient for each power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would require the \\(c\\) part to be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about the sum of all coefficients being 64, but that's when you set \\(c = 1\\). But in this case, we're specifically looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first polynomial, so we need to multiply it by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but each of those terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power.

Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is separate.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-(6 - m)})\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). Wait, no, let me see: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, as I calculated before, is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make sense if the problem is asking for a specific term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different. So, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's just 384. Let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, as we saw by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively scaling the coefficient by 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I misread the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by terms from the second part that result in \\(c^0\\). So, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the product to have \\(c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6 is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part with coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that's different from my earlier thought. So, I think I initially misread the problem. It's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, because if the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it would have been 384, but that's not typical. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term with multiple variables, it's looking for the term where all the variables have the specified exponents. So, in this case, it's likely \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Multiplying those together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had considered the entire sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, then 6 * 64 would be 384, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem just specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's ambiguous whether it's considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just \\(c^0\\). Hmm, perhaps I should check both interpretations.\n\nIf it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing their coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. Let me check that again.\n\nYes, because in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Maybe I should stick to the first interpretation where it's just 384. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems odd because when you have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the term, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is separate, so when it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where all variables have the specified exponents.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should just stick to the first interpretation, which is that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut I'm more confident now that the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's if we're considering all powers of \\(c\\), which seems odd because it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is present, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables.\n\nI think I need to accept that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but no, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should just go with the initial interpretation where the coefficient is 384, because that's what you get when you consider the entire expansion. So, I'll conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut now I'm second-guessing myself because I think the problem is more likely asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\), which is also a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's expecting a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384, but that's not a number, it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the sum of coefficients, i.e., the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent because when \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just accept that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the answer I should go with. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in two variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking about this. I'll go with 120 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we also find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts because it looks like two separate expansions multiplied together.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that part is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part affects the coefficient. Since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I might need to consider how the terms from the second expansion interact with the first one. But wait, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply them together, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm looking for terms where, after multiplying, the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will get multiplied by every term in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would actually be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify: When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just contribute a multiple to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion would contribute a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as a term in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. \n\nSo, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you might have to consider more terms, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part and the second part contributes a constant term, I think it's correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion. Setting the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, we solve:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nFinally, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts because the expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, I think I can handle each part separately and then combine them somehow.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2, and the exponent on \\(a\\) would then be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other terms don't affect this? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the second expansion don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, right?\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, maybe the coefficient remains the same? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since each term in the second part is a power of \\(c\\), each of those terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would be multiplied by each term, so the coefficient would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), each with their own coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiplying by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\). So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that's not right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term in the product, but it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, no, that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once in the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it creates multiple terms, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific terms. For example, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6 by each of these terms, you get 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but it's being multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because each term in the second part is a separate term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first part. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding more terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part. When you multiply it by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest are different terms. Wait, that seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but that can't be because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are separate from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the term in the second expansion where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all the terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. But that contradicts the previous thought where I considered only the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient when \\(k = 0\\), because that's when the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate because we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would imply that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms, which isn't the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part when \\(k = 3\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The first expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will produce terms \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But that's 6 times the sum of binomial coefficients, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the previous conclusion. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from second expansion}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first expansion, because the second expansion's terms are in \\(c\\), which are different variables. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, you're distributing the terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's in the entire expansion, considering all variables. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the terms are combined.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but the term's coefficient in the product is the product of the coefficients. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), its coefficient in the first polynomial is 6, and in the second polynomial, every term has a coefficient, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is a separate factor. But no, the problem is the product of both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems to make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 * 64.\n\nBut now I'm questioning if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, not considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the product includes terms with \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that's not specified. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems contradictory because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product with each possible power of \\(c\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, it would be the sum of the coefficients when \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\).\n\nWait, that seems to align with the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, the first part is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second part is \\(c^2 + 2 + 2/c + 1/c^2\\). The product would be:\n\n\\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nSo, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it's \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), so the coefficient is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, it would be the sum of the coefficients when \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 6 = 6. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), whose sum of coefficients is 6, but the actual coefficient is a polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, but if we're only interested in the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 2. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut now I'm really confused. Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is a polynomial, and the sum of its coefficients is 6, which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product, it's the sum of coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simple example, when I expanded, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed a polynomial, but if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's that polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in the entire product, it's implied that you're looking for the coefficient when all variables are present, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Typically, the coefficient is a numerical factor, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I'm getting myself in circles here. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with different powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), which is a polynomial, but if we're asked for the coefficient, it's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, giving 384.\n\nI'm really confused now. Maybe I should look up similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the first and second polynomials. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. But each term in the second polynomial is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is present in all those terms, the total coefficient would be the sum of all contributions, which is 6 * 64.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me check with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. If I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's that polynomial. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms, it's the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the term where \\(c^0\\). But based on the examples, it seems that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. So, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and use the binomial theorem for each.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I can break it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. So, when I multiply them out, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the product of terms from each expansion. But wait, actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will only come from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first expansion, and it won't be multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms because those are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient remains the same. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, the first expression has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a sum of terms, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the term where \\(k=2\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this as well using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think we're only interested in the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\) would have the same coefficients as \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then we'd have to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion and multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, that might make more sense. Let me check that. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe it's considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. That would make sense because then it's a single coefficient. So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial. But that's not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to confirm. Let's consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this would be a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with coefficients \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), each multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), then we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the total coefficient would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check both interpretations.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's possible that it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, that doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nSo, to find that, we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that's if we're considering the sum over all \\(c\\) terms. So, which is it?\n\nLet me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without any restriction on \\(c\\), then technically, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for similar problems online to see how they handle this. Wait, but I can't access the internet, so I'll have to think it through.\n\nLet me consider an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Wait, but that's a different case because the exponents don't allow for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear.\n\nWait, in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) can produce \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present unless \\(c^k\\) is 1, i.e., when \\(k=0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but in that case, the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single term. So, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's expand both parts.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), \\(36a^2b^2/c^4\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, multiplied by 120, which is when the second term is 20 (the constant term). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the expanded form, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, not by 1. Wait, no, in the expansion, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\), which is the term where \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's 120 because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). If the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), it would be 90, and so on. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term. Maybe I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's considering all possible terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120 when considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), which is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

    "text": " Maybe I should start by expanding each part separately and then see how they combine.\n\nFirst, let's look at \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that the binomial theorem can be used here. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying that to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\nI'm specifically interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient here is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Each term will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I don't need to consider this part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the entire second part just contributes a constant factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by each term from the first. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it just adds a coefficient, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from the second expansion would just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by its coefficient. So, maybe I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so if I set \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} \\times 1^{6 - m} \\times 1^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product, so when I expand it, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part can be any term, but when multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just have its coefficient multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute each part separately and then multiply the coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes all its terms, so the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the second part again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so that's indeed \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\).\n\nSo, yes, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're just looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand it, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then I would need to find the corresponding term in the second expansion, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check the second expansion again. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) more carefully.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is it correct to just multiply by the sum of the coefficients? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient to the product. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can think of it as the product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part, each contributing their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts because it's a product of two binomial expressions. I remember something about the binomial theorem, so maybe that can help.\n\nFirst, I know that when you expand a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), each term is given by \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, right? So maybe I can apply that to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So maybe I don't even need to worry about the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part because it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, so perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) would just multiply it. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems confusing.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term in the expansion would be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect the overall expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So that means that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion (which is a polynomial in \\(c\\)) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be that coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Maybe I should think differently. Let me try to compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So that's 6.\n\nNow, the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So that means we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial gives the coefficient of that term in the product. So in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion (which is 64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in that case, yes, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this approach. Let me consider a simpler example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\((c + 1)\\) is \\(c + 1\\). The product is \\(a^2(c + 1) + 2ab(c + 1) + b^2(c + 1)\\), which is \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2ab c + 2ab + b^2 c + b^2\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2). So 1 * 2 = 2. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\), so their coefficients are 1 and 1, respectively. Wait, but 1 + 1 = 2, which matches 1 * 2. So that seems to work.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so perhaps it's just 6, but that can't be right because the product would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, so it's just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the other part of the product would affect the coefficient when multiplied.\n\nWait, no, I think my initial approach is correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) first. As I did earlier, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this expansion, each term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second expansion. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, this term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the coefficients 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So that seems consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). That's the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), their product's coefficient for a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), is the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So yes, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about the variables. In the product, each term is a combination of a term from P(a, b) and a term from Q(c). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think about it that way, maybe I could have considered expanding both parts and looking for the coefficient, but that would be more time-consuming. I think my approach is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 384 is the right answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Maybe I should break it down into parts because it looks like it's two separate expansions multiplied together. \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). \n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just 1? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient. Hmm, maybe that's too hasty. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because only then, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, and then sum up their coefficients? But that would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is just about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression is just multiplied by it. So, maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too high. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nOkay, so let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so that the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the right approach. Let me confirm by thinking about it differently. \n\nThe entire expression is the product of two expansions. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. The second expansion has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. \n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
