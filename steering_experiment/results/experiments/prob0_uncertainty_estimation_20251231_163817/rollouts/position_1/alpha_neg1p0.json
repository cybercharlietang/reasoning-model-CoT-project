    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nI'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, so the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, so when I multiply these two expressions, the variables from each part don't interact in terms of exponents. That is, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) won't combine with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms from the other part. \n\nSo, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the variables don't interfere. But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in that expansion will just add a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but no, actually, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're creating terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I've already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the product, each term is the product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the constant term from the second part because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so \\(n = 4\\). I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nSo, I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Let me compute that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, which is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\)?\n\nHmm, yes, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's all about \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since it's a term without \\(c\\), it's like a scalar multiplied by each term. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply.\n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the second part only involves \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but the variables are different. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the entire expansion of the second part? That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, which is a product of two polynomials, we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But since the second part only has \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes sense now. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it by assuming it's \\(c^0\\). Let me think again.\n\nIf the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6. But given the way the problem is written, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables, so that would mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), hence 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I think I should break this down into two parts because the expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that this term comes from the expansion of the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nSo, maybe I should focus on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) first and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 4\\), and I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Since \\(n = 4\\), plugging in \\(k = 2\\) gives us \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), which matches. So, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). Let me compute that: \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to consider the second part of the original expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear here, I think the coefficient from this part will just multiply the coefficient we found earlier.\n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that term would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) to give just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in that expansion.\n\nLet me use the binomial theorem again for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in the expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nFirst, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6 because 4! / (2!2!) = 24 / 4 = 6. \n\nThen, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, since 6! / (3!3!) = 720 / (6*6) = 20. \n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part of the expression, \\((a + b)^4\\), I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me write that out. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4.\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).\n\nThat means, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the variables involved.\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. Each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nI want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again because 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6 \u00d7 6 = 36, and 720 \u00f7 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the constant term in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient is the product of these two, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the constant term the only term that affects \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion that don't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the only way it affects the coefficient is by multiplying by 1, meaning the constant term. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 is correct.\n\nJust to double-check, let me think about the overall structure. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term, so they don't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Using the binomial theorem, each term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSetting the exponent of \\(c\\) to zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, each term in the expansion is a combination of powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nIn this problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. \n\nSo, let me find that term. If \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I can calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, this looks similar to the binomial theorem as well. Let me apply the binomial theorem here too. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). \n\nSimplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which combines to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, in the original problem, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so I think the part involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But no, that's not exactly right because each term in the second part is multiplied by each term in the first part.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which are variables, so unless we're considering \\(c\\) terms as coefficients, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is a separate variable. But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the problem is actually considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would have coefficients multiplied by the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire sum of the coefficients of the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms would be the product of the coefficients from both parts.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = A \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B \\), then the product is \\( A \\times B \\). So, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're looking for all terms in \\(A \\times B\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively. But since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are separate, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\) and multiply it by each term from \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\(A\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which aren't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I calculated earlier, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2m = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\(2m = 6\\)\n\n\\(m = 3\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the two coefficients we found, we multiply 6 and 20 together:\n\n6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But wait, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the second part when looking for this specific term. Hmm, that might be the case.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So applying that here, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficients for each term can be found using the binomial coefficients. Specifically, I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I think I need to consider how the two expansions interact. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), maybe I can treat the two parts separately.\n\nLet me explain: when I multiply two polynomials, the terms multiply term by term. So if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants (i.e., have \\(c^0\\)), because only those will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it will result in a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which could be \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), or \\(c^{-6}\\). So when I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I might be considering only the constant term from the second expansion because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some integer. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's possible that it's referring to the coefficient in the product without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression includes \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) terms cancel out, so that the resulting term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. But that might not be the case.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. So that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let me calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, for the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the overall expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient when the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20, as I found earlier. So the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and then look for the specific term. So, in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the other expansion as 20, so when multiplied together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the products of coefficients from each expansion where the exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. So yeah, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there are other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with higher exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) combine with a term from the second expansion to give \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms? But no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct.\n\nSo, multiplying those together, 6 * 20 = 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and see if there's another way to approach it, but I think this method is solid. So I think the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. \n\nSo, in this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Let me write out the general term for the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), which is correct. \n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, wait a second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the second part just gets multiplied as a whole. \n\nLet me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), the multiplication would just multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms in the second expansion won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in the first expansion. That is, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when considering the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thereby contributing to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that would be a term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^{-6}\\) would be \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the exponent of \\(c\\) should be zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the term without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Hmm, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). \n\nBut wait, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, which is of the form \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible terms where \\(c^k\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that's not correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only a part of the product. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that's a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to have a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), then actually, every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. So, which one is correct? \n\nLet me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, no, because the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. \n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), thereby contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all such terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. If you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 would be 384, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then actually, all the terms in the second expansion contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems high. \n\nWait, let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by a term in the second polynomial, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when \\(k = 0\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where \\(k = 0\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts and multiplying. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNext, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nThe constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense now. The key was realizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it must be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Otherwise, the term would have an exponent of \\(c\\), which is not part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) includes the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), making each of those terms a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part? Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAnd the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought earlier, is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this another way. Suppose I don't substitute \\(c = 1\\), but instead, I think of the product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^{i}c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(i = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, in the double sum, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^{i}c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, for each \\(j\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nAnd the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because in the expansion, each term is a product of \\(a^{4 - i}b^i\\) and \\(c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're essentially summing over all the possible \\(j\\) terms, because each \\(j\\) contributes a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. So, that means we have to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by 6.\n\nSo yes, 6 * 64 = 384 seems to be the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it as the product of two independent expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second expansion is multiplied entirely, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) (which is like \\(a^1b^0\\)) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the same as the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm just considering the coefficient in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, perhaps in our original problem, it's the same idea. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients. But no, because the second part isn't a single term; it's an entire expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second part). \n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is equivalent to 64 in our original problem. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the exponents of \\(c\\) might affect the coefficient? For example, does the problem consider terms like \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) as separate from \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), or are they all considered together when just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent?\n\nI think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum of all such contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when considering \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, no. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this product, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will contribute to the overall expression. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, no\u2014because the entire expression is the product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be a term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. When we expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or do we need to find a specific term where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power? \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by a sum of terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) where \\(k\\) varies. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, plugging \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, but in reality, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables multiplied together, the coefficient is considered as a combined term. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by every term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of coefficients, we can set \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Let's say I have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\cdot (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times 2, which is 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when considering the sum of coefficients, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. Hmm, maybe I'm conflating things here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expression from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a scalar coefficient\u2014it's a polynomial.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem isn't specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). \n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but when we're asked for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, since the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the problem. The expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I can handle each part separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), each term is given by the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me figure out what \\(k\\) would be in this case. If \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, what about the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, so does that mean the term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the \\(c\\) part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the other part as a constant when considering the coefficient?\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. When we multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so does that mean we're considering the coefficient in the entire expanded expression, or just in the part without \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is structured such that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two parts, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficients of their respective terms multiply when you're looking at the product of specific terms. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is about \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when we expand the entire expression, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean we're looking for the term where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would stand alone without any \\(c\\) factors.\n\nWait, that might make sense. So, to clarify, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, thereby contributing to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. But in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the initial part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by expanding both parts. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The middle term, where the exponent is 0, is when \\(k = 3\\), as I found earlier, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(20c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there's no other term in the second expansion that would affect \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a different interpretation. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so their coefficients add up? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out?\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you're considering the entire expression, including all variables. So, if the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's expand this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (c + 1/c), so 1*(1 + 1) = 2, but if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 1*(1 + 1) = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 2*2 = 4.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, but that's only if we're considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, which isn't the case. So, perhaps in the problem, the coefficient is being considered as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because in the expansion, each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), each with their own coefficients. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include another variable, it's usually considered as the coefficient when that other variable is set to 1, or when you're only interested in the term without that variable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nLet me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present when \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\), it's multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the question would be a bit strange, as it's asking for the coefficient of a term that appears in multiple forms with different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let's see. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient that is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check with a smaller exponent. Suppose the second part was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is \\(c + 1/c\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*(1 + 1) = 12. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c\\) and \\(6a^2b^2/c\\), so the coefficients would be 6 and 6, adding up to 12 when considering all terms. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, if the second part was \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(1 + 2 + 1) = 6*4=24. Let's see: \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) would have terms \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(12a^2b^2\\), and \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), so the coefficients are 6, 12, and 6, which sum up to 24 when considering all terms. So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, which is correct? I'm getting conflicting results based on interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 384, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nI think the problem is ambiguous, but given that it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without any mention of \\(c\\), it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as well, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is the sum of all such terms, which would be 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term is a monomial with specific powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present in the product when it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but that seems high, so let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Each of those coefficients is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), where \\(m\\) is such that \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) gives the exponent for \\(c\\). So, for each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). That is, 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6*2^6=6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent.\n\nSuppose the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*(1 + 1) = 12, as each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each with coefficient 6. So, the total coefficient is 12, which is 6*2.\n\nSimilarly, if the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), which is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(1 + 2 + 1)=6*4=24, which is correct because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^2\\), 2, and \\(1/c^2\\), with coefficients 6, 12, and 6 respectively, adding up to 24.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, with \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, which was the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it? I think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nGiven that the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's more accurate to interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Because if they wanted the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), they would probably phrase it differently, like \"the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" or something similar.\n\nWait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the way the problem is phrased. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but as it stands, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let's check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I initially thought. Because if you set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that would be 6*64=384. But that's not the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, but if you set \\(c = 1\\), you're effectively removing the \\(c\\) dependence, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6*64=384. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384.\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting interpretations. I think the key is to realize that in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. It comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. Each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm getting confused because I'm not sure how to interpret the problem. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 384.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the problem would be a bit strange, as it's not common to ask for the coefficient of a term without considering another variable.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that \\(c\\) is treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me check with a different approach. Let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120, as it's the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 384, but now I see that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\) is 120, and all other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, then it's 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present is 384. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem, this would expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, each term in this expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nNow, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should figure out which term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let's see, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term would be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I'm supposed to multiply this by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found the relevant term for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6.\n\nBut wait, I think I might be overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut hold on, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute a multiple to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would actually be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, which is 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms will multiply the 6 from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we just consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion?\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is... but wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct. Let me check: The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that can't be right because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would be 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part could contribute to the coefficient. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is through the first part. Therefore, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second factor. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, those coefficients add up.\n\nSo, to find the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nLet me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem to this part first. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient.\n\nHmm, let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, every term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes only from the \\(6 \\cdot a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when I multiply this term by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we need the terms where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, to get a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\), the corresponding term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would otherwise introduce powers of \\(c\\) that we don't want in the final term.\n\nSo, essentially, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which is 6. Then, the product of these two will give me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let's focus on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). Let's compute that term:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\cdot 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\cdot 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is indeed 6, as we saw earlier. Then, the constant term in the second part is 20, which I calculated using the binomial theorem. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way to confirm. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I were to expand this, each term would be of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\text{(coefficient from first expansion)} \\times a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\text{(coefficient from second expansion)} \\times c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\n\\]\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives the coefficient 6. Then, in the second expansion, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which we found to be when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just double-check the calculations for the binomial coefficients to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs at \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That's correct because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning, so I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), and so on, each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write that down. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). I want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs, which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have this other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I need to consider. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I also need to consider the other part? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part?\n\nLet me think. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, when I multiply by the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by each term from the second part, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the sums of the products of coefficients from each expression. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how that term is formed in the product.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), so the second expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with a different approach to make sure I'm not wrong. Another way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficient of a term involving only those variables is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, from the first part, we have 6, and from the second part, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Wait, no, that's not right because the constant term is just one term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6\\(a^2b^2c^6\\), 6\\(a^2b^2c^4\\), 6\\(a^2b^2c^2\\), 6\\(a^2b^2\\), 6\\(a^2b^2/c^2\\), 6\\(a^2b^2/c^4\\), and 6\\(a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\) terms) would just be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. But wait, the constant term in the second expansion is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when the exponents from both terms cancel out.\n\nWait, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with an example. Suppose I have two expressions: (x + y)^1 * (z + 1/z)^1. Let's say I want the coefficient of x^1y^0. That would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is (1 + 1) = 2, so the coefficient would be 2. But if I were to look for the coefficient of x^1y^0z^0, it would be 1 * 1 = 1.\n\nSo, in the original problem, if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. If it were asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the coefficients of all these terms, which is 6 * (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if it were \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it another way. Let me expand both expressions separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nWait, let me calculate that:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power, like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the given expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then see how they combine.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Applying the binomial theorem here, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Got that part.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the question is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can treat this part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might not be correct because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients from both parts will multiply.\n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other part doesn't affect it. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider that any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero power of \\(c\\) will not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would be a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand the entire product, each term would be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by a term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAh, that makes more sense.

So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial where the variables not involved (in this case, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) are multiplied by the constant term. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it.

    "text": " \n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms will be from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients. Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that:\n\nIf \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, does that mean the entire expression is a product, so the \\(c\\) terms will be multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that part? Or do they?\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's just multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion? But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient in the product, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems off.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Maybe the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from both expansions. But that's confusing because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense, so I must be misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nSo, let me rephrase the problem: Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That means I need to find the term where, in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second part, we have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nLet me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, which seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product. \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write each term as \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients from each part multiply together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would multiply to give a constant term if their exponents cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to make sure that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a term that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, actually, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a coefficient of 20 for \\(c^0\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(20\\) from the second part, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Alternatively, we can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate binomial expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, yes, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem.

The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations or Pascal's triangle.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, I can expand this part separately. Let me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nThe binomial coefficients for \\(n = 4\\) are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, that becomes:\n\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.\n\nI think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the corresponding terms in each expansion. But since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I might need to find terms in the second expansion that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, no. The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when we multiply them together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the first part has only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are separate. Therefore, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms, but we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should consider that the second expansion is just a scalar multiple for the first part. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the second expansion is a sum of terms, so maybe I need to think of it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the first expression has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expression, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial in c, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, you'll have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. Each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I'm looking for all terms where the powers of a and b are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the powers of c. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of a, b, and c are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with c, which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, c all together, but that seems unlikely because the second part is in c and 1/c, while the first is in a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4(c + 1/c)^6\\), so when expanded, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of the exponents of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in a and b, and the second is in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial, not a number. That can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables a, b, c all together, but that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where c is raised to the 0 power. That would make sense because then we're looking for the coefficient where a is squared, b is squared, and c is to the zero power.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require that in the second expansion, we pick the term where c is raised to 0, which is the constant term.\n\nSo, let's approach it that way. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nSolving for k:\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\)\n\nSo, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but perhaps implicitly considering the term where c is also at the zero power, so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, the coefficient would involve c terms, which isn't a numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), find the constant term (c^0 term), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the second expansion more carefully.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so:\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\nWhich gives k = 3, as before. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this to both parts of the given expression.\n\nLet me start with \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n= 1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nNow, looking at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can also apply the binomial theorem here. Let me expand it:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\n\\[\n= \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, the entire original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I need to multiply each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) don't affect the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I just need the coefficient from the first part and then consider if the second part affects it.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From the expansion earlier, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, multiplying them gives 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nLet me calculate that coefficient. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 4, which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe I can consider the coefficients separately and then multiply them together?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, and it's multiplied by the first part, which is 4th power.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't being multiplied into the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only looking for terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are present, specifically \\(a^2b^2\\), the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it would just be a constant factor.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by this term.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second part?\n\nI remember that the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. When I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is independent, it's just 6 times whatever the second part contributes, but since the second part is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The entire expression is the product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all products where the terms from the first polynomial contribute \\(a^2b^2\\) and the terms from the second polynomial contribute any term, but since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only contribution comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify each step.\n\n1. Expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. That's correct.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but none with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). \n\n3. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when the entire expression is expanded, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that might not be the case. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\)?\n\nWait, the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire expression, would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we have to sum all those coefficients.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Actually, in the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the second part. But since the second part is independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to be the case.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to collect all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, you have to sum all those coefficients from Q(c).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that by an alternative approach. Let's compute the entire expansion step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has a total sum of coefficients 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether this is correct. If I were to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, each such term would be \\(6 \\times\\) a term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering each step and verifying, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: one is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the coefficient I'm looking for is related to \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So applying that here, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused about how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in this term, they don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can just consider the constant term from the second expansion because multiplying by 1 won't change the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the only term that won't introduce any \\(c\\) factors, so that when multiplied, it leaves the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unchanged.\n\nSo, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. Let me let \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = 1/c\\), so the expansion is \\((x + y)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} x^{6 - m} y^m\\). Substituting back, this becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So when you multiply these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nI think I got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts and handle each separately.\n\n1. **First Part: \\((a + b)^4\\)**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Second Part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the Results**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
