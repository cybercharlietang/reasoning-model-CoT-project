So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. And for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - m - m = 0\\), so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yeah, that seems consistent. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
