So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come about is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, just to double-check, maybe I should write out the expansions more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let's expand that a bit. The expansion is: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 (1/c)^0 = 1 \\times c^6 \\times 1 = c^6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 (1/c)^1 = 6c^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 (1/c)^2 = 15c^2\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 (1/c)^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 (1/c)^4 = 15c^{-2}\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 (1/c)^5 = 6c^{-4}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0 (1/c)^6 = 1c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the multiplication by the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just consider another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, it's sufficient to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

    "text": " Let me focus on the second part now. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other polynomial is 20. Since we're multiplying these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, as I thought earlier, only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when we multiply, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), but we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be the product of each term in the first expansion and each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part would have to be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) so that when you multiply, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, yes, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. First, binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\): correct, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expanding it and looking for the constant term, which is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0. That happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, I think I can confidently say the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, both coefficients are 6 and 20, respectively. Multiplying them gives 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
