The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - m - m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2m = 6\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\).

Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which doesn't affect the exponent) will be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply 6 * 20, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me see if there's another way to think about this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in each expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). So, yeah, that would mean taking the coefficient from each relevant part and multiplying them. So, I think my approach is correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.

I don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients just to be sure. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), 4 choose 2 is indeed 6 because 4!/(2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yep, that's correct.
