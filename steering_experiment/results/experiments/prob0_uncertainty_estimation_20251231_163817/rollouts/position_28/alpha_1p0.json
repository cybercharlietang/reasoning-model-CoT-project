Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, because the \\(c^0\\) term is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables don't interfere. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients would indeed just multiply. So, yeah, 120 should be the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product, so the coefficient is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: sometimes when you have expressions multiplied together, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's the right answer. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial? For example, if I take \\(a^3b\\) from the first part and multiply by a term from the second part that has \\(c^{-1}\\), would that somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, because the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come only from the first polynomial, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you must take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. So, that means the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two terms, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from 6 * 20, which is 120, and the \\(c^0\\) term, so the entire term is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, yes, that's consistent with what I did before. Therefore, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand them, the first part will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, as they don't interfere with each other. So, that's another way to see that it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try to compute it more formally. Let me denote the first expansion as \\(E_1 = (a + b)^4\\) and the second as \\(E_2 = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(E_1 \\times E_2\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\text{(term from E1)} \\times \\text{(term from E2)}\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(E_1\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found. The term in \\(E_2\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, as we found. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient from \\(E_1\\) is 6, and from \\(E_2\\) it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when variables are involved, there might be more terms contributing, but in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, and we're only looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the specific terms from each expansion. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find this, I first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, I think that's correct.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere.
