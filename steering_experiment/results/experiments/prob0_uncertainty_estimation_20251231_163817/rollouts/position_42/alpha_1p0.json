The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second part. So, when expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient is the product. If we took any other term from the second polynomial, it would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), and thus the product would have a \\(c\\) term, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).
