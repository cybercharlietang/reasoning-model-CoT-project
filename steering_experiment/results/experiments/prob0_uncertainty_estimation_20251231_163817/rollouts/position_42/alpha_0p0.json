    "text": " In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in either part. Let's re-examine the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, yes, \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term with coefficient 6. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). When \\(m = 3\\), the exponent is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), which don't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the ways that when you multiply a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you end up with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that means the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) must be \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) must be \\(c^0\\). Because if you take any other term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would have a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, indeed, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what I did earlier. So, that's another way to see that it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
