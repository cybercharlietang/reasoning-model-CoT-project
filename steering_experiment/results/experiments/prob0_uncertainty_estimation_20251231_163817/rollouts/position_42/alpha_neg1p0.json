Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But we're only interested in the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that's correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more explicitly. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, as I calculated. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we only take the term where the second factor is 20, because that's the constant term.

I think that's solid.\n\nWait, just another thought: could there be any other terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I take a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's not the constant term, would that ever result in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term? No, because the second factor doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, any term from the second factor would only affect the \\(c\\) part, not the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part.
