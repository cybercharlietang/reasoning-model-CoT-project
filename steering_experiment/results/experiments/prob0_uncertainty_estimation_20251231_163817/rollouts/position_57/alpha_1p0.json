    "text": " Maybe I should write it out again to make sure. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by 20, giving 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, hold on, let me think again. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes 6a^2b^2 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but no, that's not right because the second part isn't a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yeah, that's why it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."
