When I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I want the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Let me go through it again. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two expressions, you have to consider all possible combinations that could result in the term you're interested in. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second. So, I think my reasoning is correct.

So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients found:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
