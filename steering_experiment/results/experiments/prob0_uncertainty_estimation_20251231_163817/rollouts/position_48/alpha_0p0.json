    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, could the problem be interpreted differently? For example, maybe the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), since \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), we would have to consider other terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second polynomial. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
