    "text": " Let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6.

So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) with coefficient 6*20=120. There are no other terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that can combine with terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\), because any other term from the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), making the product have a \\(c\\) term.

    "text": " Maybe I should verify by expanding both parts a bit more. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), let me write out the terms around \\(c^0\\). The expansion is: \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20, which confirms that the coefficient is 20. So, when I multiply 6 and 20, I get 120.
