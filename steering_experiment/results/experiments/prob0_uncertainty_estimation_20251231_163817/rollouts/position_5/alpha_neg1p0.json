    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying those coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, actually, no. That might not be right. Let me clarify: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we're summing over all possible terms. \n\nWait, that might not be correct either. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (doesn't involve \\(c\\)), the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nOh, I see my confusion. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expanded form. But since the entire expression is a product of two expressions, each involving different variables, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something includes \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nI think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient is just a number, not a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms with coefficients that sum to \\(2^6\\). But wait, that might not be accurate because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), but each term in the expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to consider how the second part contributes to the coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nThe sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me verify. Suppose I have two expressions, \\(X = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Y = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product \\(XY\\) would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\cdot c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(XY\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(X\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\). \n\nYes, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Y\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which only happens if \\(m = 0\\). But in the expansion of \\(Y\\), the only term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when \\(m = 3\\). \n\nWait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Y\\), but rather 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Y\\), because only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nLet me check that. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(Y\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\(Y\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Y\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\(X\\), which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from \\(Y\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, so my initial thought was wrong because I didn't consider that only the constant term in \\(Y\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That makes more sense because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^m\\), it's a different term, not \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c^m = c^0\\) would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, so maybe I should also expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Let me do that. The binomial expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've expanded earlier, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, in the multiplication, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is just a constant with respect to the second part, which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nOh, I see! So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when multiplied by the second factor, which is a series in terms of \\(c\\), the entire expression becomes a product. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it? Because when you multiply by the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the coefficient itself would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't possible because the coefficient should be a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a constant. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) term would be 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. That seems a bit strange because usually, when we talk about coefficients, we consider them as constants. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, so the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. \n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think again. If I consider the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nLet me see, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. So, to get \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120? \n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a constant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it should specify that it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term in \\(c\\). But as it stands, the problem is a bit ambiguous. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve all the terms from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each corresponding term in the second expansion. But when we talk about the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), we usually consider it in the context of all variables, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nLet me try to clarify. If the problem had been asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then it would make sense, but it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because when we talk about the coefficient of a term, we usually consider it in the context of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense, as the coefficient would be a constant. \n\nGiven that, let me proceed under that assumption. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nFrom the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second expansion, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the first part gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 20. So, when I multiply these together, I get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a constant. \n\nWait, no, actually, if you consider the entire product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if we're just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, and the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. \n\nBut that seems to contradict my earlier thought where I considered \\(c^0\\). So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nWait, maybe I can check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems too simplistic because the entire expression also includes the second factor. \n\nWait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, if you consider the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems odd because usually, when we talk about coefficients, we consider them with respect to all variables. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the constant term, that is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, it's 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to see which one makes sense. If I consider the problem as written, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve all the terms from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a constant, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Given that, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion and is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a constant. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which is less common. Therefore, I will proceed under that assumption. \n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nFrom the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nFrom the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. As I calculated earlier, that occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first expansion gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion gives me \\(20c^0\\). Multiplying these together, I get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense unless the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer is 120, as that's the coefficient when considering the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\) and has a coefficient of 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out: \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nWait, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I remember that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{24}{4}\\) = 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, right? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, the resulting terms will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, it's like multiplying by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. \n\nWait, but the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2 and 2. So, actually, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each part. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), since it's only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial, so we can't just multiply by the entire expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), each of those terms will just add a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) will make each term equal to its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the product will be a combination of a term from the first part and a term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not an expression. \n\nWait, no, because the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded as a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When you multiply the first part by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms that have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial calculation is correct: 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(c\\) terms as constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a numerical coefficient, so I think I need to consider that when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the second part only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second part, you're just adding a factor that involves \\(c\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain 2 and 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a sum, not a single term. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of each term in the first part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) and each term in the second part. But since only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I must be missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, if I let the second part be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), then each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. If I consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the answer would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. So, each of these products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Let me calculate the coefficients here. The binomial coefficients for 4 are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1. So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can already see that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nHmm, okay, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply two expressions together, the terms multiply term by term. So, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). That means that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact unless they somehow affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, actually, when I multiply the entire expressions, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficients from the second part will just scale the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply the entire expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be multiplied by all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term that also has \\(c\\) in it. \n\nWait a minute, that means I might be misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or is it specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\)? Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, unless there's a term with \\(c^0\\), which is just 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product of the two expressions, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, that seems right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term in the second expression has a coefficient, and when you sum them all, you get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, first, let me confirm: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in this expansion because when I multiply each term by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients will add up. \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I think the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) equal to 64? Let me check by expanding it a bit. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because each term in the second expression contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) has coefficient 1, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(6c^4\\) has coefficient 6, and so on. So, when you add up all these coefficients, you get 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, and then multiply by 6 from the first part, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficients just multiply. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate 6 * 64. 6 * 60 is 360, and 6 * 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could have approached this problem by considering the multinomial expansion, but I think the way I did it is correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part? Or is it more complicated?\n\nWait, no, I think I might be misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical when asking for a coefficient in such a problem. So, I think I need to find the term where, in addition to \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both parts separately, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where, after multiplication, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nSo, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply those two coefficients together. Because when you multiply the terms, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part will give you \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, let me make sure. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part, when expanded, will have a term with \\(c^0\\), which is just 1, but with a certain coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is what I need to find, and then I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me just double-check my reasoning. So, I expanded each part separately, found the coefficients for the specific terms, and then multiplied them because of the multiplication of the two expressions. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could have considered the entire expansion, but that would be more complicated, so breaking it down into parts seems efficient.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two separate binomial expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms that combine to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and \\(c^0\\), which comes from the second expansion. So, multiplying their coefficients gives the final coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are straightforward: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiplying them together.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nFinal Answer: \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts together.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since these are two separate parts multiplied together, the terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) will multiply each other. So, when I expand \\(A \\times B\\), each term from \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(B\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider all the terms from \\(B\\), just those that don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, so when I multiply \\(A \\times B\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will just be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we can consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in \\(A\\), and \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is a separate factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(A\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the only way for the product to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in \\(B\\) are just constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\(A\\)) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient, I need to calculate the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let's compute that.\n\nWhen \\(c = 1\\), \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\(A\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in \\(B\\)), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just the coefficient from \\(A\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me verify this by another approach. Let me expand both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, as before, \\(A = (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(B = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(B\\) is:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, \\(B = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the terms will have variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if the term from \\(B\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. So, actually, the only term in \\(B\\) that would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\(A\\)) times 20 (from \\(B\\)), which is 120.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I misunderstood how the multiplication works. Since \\(A\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the variables are separate. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) by a term from \\(B\\) that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is only the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If I consider the entire product, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^4\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the term \\(a^3b\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. The same goes for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\), which when multiplied by each term in \\(B\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(B\\) (which is 20) will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from \\(B\\) will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) being multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), and thus not equal to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I mistakenly thought that the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, and then multiplied that by 6. But that approach is incorrect because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the variables are separate. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(B\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term.\n\nSo, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check this by another method. Alternatively, I can consider the entire expansion and see what terms contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(A\\) is \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). The only term in \\(A\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). In \\(B\\), the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the middle term, which is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense now. So, the initial mistake was thinking that all terms in \\(B\\) contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, only the constant term in \\(B\\) does, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term have \\(c\\) raised to some power, thus not being just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Next, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is expanded, and the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is found to be 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. Hmm, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, and their coefficients multiply as well. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and then multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will have a term with \\(c\\) raised to some power. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

Each term has its own coefficient, so if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient when considering all the terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second part, which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the question.

Alternatively, maybe it's a misstatement and they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in other variables.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each of those terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each term has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too high.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all those coefficients, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 6 times 2^6, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found using the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I'm confused. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we can compute that. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. But that's not correct because each term is separate. Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly the problem is asking. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we need to find that specific coefficient. Since the problem didn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But I'm not entirely sure because the problem might be interpreted differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that's not a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \"in\" the expression, so it's considering the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else. But assuming the problem is correct as given, I think the intended answer is 120, considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term where \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we have the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. That makes sense because it's a specific term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that's not a constant, so I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a constant, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product, and when expanded, each term will have the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k=2\\), and its coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but I'm not sure how that works.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, it's the entire expansion, so 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120 when considering the term where \\(c^0\\) is present.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me write out the entire expansion.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part, but each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6*20=120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6*6=36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1=6.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all these coefficients, which would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = let's calculate that: 6+36=42, 42+90=132, 132+120=252, 252+90=342, 342+36=378, 378+6=384. So, the total sum is 384.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. However, in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's usually considering the term with the specified variables and all possible exponents of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But that seems less likely because coefficients are typically for specific terms, not sums across multiple terms.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because each term in the product is a separate term. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't a single coefficient but rather a collection of coefficients for different powers of \\(c\\). So, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but as it is, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think of it another way. If I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I were to write the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't a single number but a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the sum of all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 384. So, maybe that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but let me think carefully. In algebra, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120, as I found earlier. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying the power of \\(c\\), is actually the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the standard interpretation. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, it's for a specific combination of variables and exponents. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check some references. In algebra, the coefficient of a term in a product is typically for a specific term, not summed over multiple terms. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try to think of it as a generating function. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6*64=384. So, that seems to support the idea that the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially evaluating the expression at \\(c=1\\), which gives me the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6*64=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. I'm confused now. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1=6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, and so on. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) with the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me compute those coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. \n\nHmm, so the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. That means that when I multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the entire second part. Because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expression, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\) would just be the coefficient in \\(P\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only exists in \\(P(a, b)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that can't be right because \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P(a, b)\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in \\(Q(c)\\). However, that would actually mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\)). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, and \\(c\\) only appears in the second part, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), depending on the terms in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to find all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and then sum their coefficients. \n\nSo, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and we can't just multiply by the entire expansion; we have to consider each term's coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me break it down. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, to get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all those coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do we find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), which equals 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this reasoning. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64 when \\(c = 1\\). And since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, multiplying them gives 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6.\n\n2. **Determine the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), which would make \\(k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, maybe the multiplication just scales the coefficient by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied as a whole. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the overall expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because then it's just 6 times the entire second expression, which isn't a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiplying it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because if we're looking for a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)), then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term from the second expression.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when you multiply, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, so that the overall term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, hence the coefficient being 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with those of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the product where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term, so that the coefficient is a pure number, not involving \\(c\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

We want the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, plugging in the numbers, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply term by term. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can actually consider that the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple when it comes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to consider all the possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, and the exponents add. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOh, that makes sense now. So, I need to find two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. \n\nSo, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, step by step: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. \n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, and only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since we don't want any \\(c\\) terms). \n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120.

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. \n\nHmm, so maybe I should think about how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(c^0\\) which is 1, and then negative powers of \\(c\\). \n\nBut when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be, because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself wouldn't exist unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (the constant term), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. Any other term from the second expansion would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero, which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20.\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. The second part's constant term is 20, correct. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. However, only the term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they'll give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will depend on the coefficients from both parts. Let me think about how this multiplication works. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nNo, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But actually, the second part doesn't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) just remain as they are. So, in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the product would have terms in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be the same as in the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, right? \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the entire product is a product of two polynomials, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. But wait, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, there is a constant term when \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary since the variables are separate. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, their coefficients don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables match. \n\nWait, but in this case, the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. So, that makes sense. \n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs at \\(k = 3\\), with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, looking at the expansion, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!}\\). So, 4 factorial is 24, and 2 factorial is 2, so 24 divided by (2 times 2) is 24/4, which is 6. So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. \n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider specific terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that might affect the coefficient?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need the coefficient that comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term, which has coefficients, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. \n\nNo, actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients from each expression. So, for example, if I have \\( (x + y) \\times (z + w) \\), the coefficient of \\(x z\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, the coefficient of \\(x w\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, and so on. \n\nSo, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\)? \n\nWait, no, because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the sum of all the coefficients from each term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But I don't think that's what we need here. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? \n\nIn that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut is that correct? Let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, that's different. \n\nWait, no, in that case, the product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and the second expansion is only degree 1 in \\(c\\). So, the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But according to my earlier logic, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the second expression becomes 2, so the coefficient would be 2 * coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 2 * 1 = 2, but that's incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. \n\nSo, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this. \n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because the second part doesn't contain any terms with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're just adding terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only affects the powers of \\(c\\), it doesn't introduce any new \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term remains as is, just multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with my earlier example where I thought the coefficient would be zero. Let me clarify. \n\nIn the example, when I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the product doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), you're just scaling each term by a power of \\(c\\), but you can't get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), which isn't possible in this product. \n\nWait, no, actually, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). When you multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to multiply \\(a^2\\) from the first term by \\(b^2\\) from the second term, but in reality, each term in the product is a single term from the first expansion multiplied by a single term from the second expansion. So, you can't get cross terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) unless you have both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) in the same term, which you don't because each term is either \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), or \\(b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no such term. But in this case, the first expansion does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expansion, it will produce multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, in the problem, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum their coefficients? Or is the problem expecting a different interpretation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient (a number) times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds up all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, in the example I had earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, but according to this logic, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2 * 2 = 4, which is incorrect because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nSo, that suggests that my logic is flawed. Therefore, I need to find another approach. \n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since the coefficient is a number, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually an infinite series if we consider all possible powers, but since the expression is a finite polynomial, it's a finite sum. \n\nBut in reality, each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. However, since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables, and \\(c\\) is a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm this with another approach. \n\nFirst, let's compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. \n\nWe already know that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) in this expansion are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nThus, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the term \\(20c^0\\) from the second expansion, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's a bit more involved. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nTherefore, after this lengthy thought process, I conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nSo, applying the binomial theorem to \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me see: in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, when is \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\)? Well, that happens when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so does that mean that the coefficient I just found, 6, is multiplied by something from the second part? Or is it just 6 because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that's a good question. \n\nLet me think. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by the first part. So, when we expand the entire expression, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no, because when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. \n\nWait, perhaps another way to think about it is that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part remain the same, and the second part just adds a factor that doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when considering the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because the second part is multiplied by 1 with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by something else, say \\(X\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times X, where X is the coefficient of the term in \\(X\\) that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But in this case, \\(X\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is an expression in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times that constant. \n\nWait, so I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient isn't just 6. It's 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in the second part. \n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are as required, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. \n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part separately. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them, you'll have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first binomial, and when multiplied by terms from the second binomial, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because in the entire expression, the terms would involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\). But the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, the first part will have terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part will have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, and then multiply it by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that can't be right because the problem is a single term; it's not a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) alone. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that.

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. \n\nSo, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, but I think that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product are of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 0 because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present in the product. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present because the first part is only up to \\(b^2\\), but the second part is only first degree in \\(c\\). So, actually, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the first part, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab \\times 1/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), and \\(b^2 \\times 1/c\\). So, none of these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed zero. \n\nBut in the original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, that's a good point. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need to find the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the only term in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which are separate terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient. \n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). \n\nWait, so I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found is just for the first part. I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so does that mean I have to multiply this by the expansion of the second part? \n\nLet me think. The entire expression is a product of two binomials: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a scalar (6) multiplied by whatever comes from the second part. But actually, no, because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever the entire second part is. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not expressions. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\); it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple. Let me check. \n\nWait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the coefficients in the second expansion are multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so they are not scalars. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, its coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and the other in \\(c, 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me try that. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Now, when I multiply this by the first part, which is \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's constant term is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120. So, now I'm confused. Which is correct? \n\nLet me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But coefficients are scalars, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a scalar. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, its coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's just 6. But that seems too simple. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since that's a polynomial, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check online or think about similar problems. \n\nWait, in similar problems, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + d)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\((c + d)^6\\). But in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But again, that's a polynomial, not a scalar. \n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial. \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify any particular term involving \\(c\\), maybe it's implied to find the coefficient when \\(c\\) is at its constant term. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that's not a scalar. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. Alternatively, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) times \\(c^0\\), that would be 1 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 0 because there is no constant term. \n\nWait, that doesn't help. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). But that's a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 times 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that when the expression is expanded, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let's see, in the general term, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that should give me the term \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant when considering the terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the entire expansion of the second part is just a scalar multiplier for the first part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the first factor is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second factor, each term in the second factor is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expression is multiplied by the entire second expression. \n\nBut wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and they want the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient for the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times that expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(c\\) as part of the term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considered in the context where other variables are treated as constants. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe we need to express it as such. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable and the coefficient would be in terms of \\(c\\). But I'm not sure. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a scalar, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, while the second part is independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the expansion involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients are multiplied. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as we found earlier. \n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), giving us \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me go back. \n\nThe problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, and usually, coefficients are scalars. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a constant. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both parts. \n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut again, that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not typical. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product is being considered. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a function of \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that's not the case because the second part is a variable expression. \n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as two separate products: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\). \n\nWhen we multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is typically a scalar. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we're just to state the coefficient without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is part of the term, which includes \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look back at the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nGiven that, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But that seems incorrect because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. \n\nIn the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we calculated earlier. Therefore, when we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the value of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier. But that's not the case because the second part is a variable expression. \n\nI'm going in circles here. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The first expansion is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product is considered. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but without considering its power. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a scalar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut that seems like a stretch because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). As we calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nThat seems plausible. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1, giving us the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall expansion will involve terms from both expansions. \n\nHowever, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe those other terms don't affect it? Or do they?\n\nWait, no, actually, if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by something involving \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will still be present in the product, but it will have coefficients multiplied by the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by the coefficient from the first part?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's denote the first part as \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). When you multiply them, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually appear multiple times in the product, each time multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from \\(Q\\) and multiply by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\)? Because each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in \\(Q\\), it's contributing to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in \\(Q\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will still be present, but with a coefficient that's the product of the original coefficient (6) and the coefficient from the term in \\(Q\\). So, to get the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to multiply 6 by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nBut what's the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by each term in \\(Q\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, when I multiply 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 by each term in \\(Q\\), I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the variable part includes \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum all the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, essentially, we're summing over all \\(k\\) from 0 to 6, \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nSo, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to confirm my earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. That's because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, summed over all possible combinations that result in that term.\n\nIn this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients. But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). So, 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Let me try a different approach. Let me expand both expressions separately and see how the multiplication works.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) is as I wrote before: \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6}\\).\n\nCalculating the coefficients, that's \\(1c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20c^0 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + 1c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the resulting terms will be:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, each of these terms will have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times\\) the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficients will be 6*1=6, 6*6=36, 6*15=90, 6*20=120, 6*15=90, 6*6=36, 6*1=6.\n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) will have a coefficient of 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) will have 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) will have 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) (with no \\(c\\)) will have 120, \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) will have 90, \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) will have 36, and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) will have 6.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would include all these terms. Wait, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but any exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all these coefficients: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6.\n\nLet me add those up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the total coefficient is 384. That matches my earlier calculation. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term without any \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those coefficients, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be the sum of all the coefficients from each possible term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial contributes to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, so 6 * 64 = 384. That confirms it again.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That would mean the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has a second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what to do with this part. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or is there a part where \\(c\\) terms might affect the coefficient? Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, in this case, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then that term must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\), you'd get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't what we want. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part has a coefficient of 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. So, multiplying these together, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\).
