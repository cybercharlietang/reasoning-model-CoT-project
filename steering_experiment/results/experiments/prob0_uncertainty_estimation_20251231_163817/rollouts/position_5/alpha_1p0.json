    "text": " Let me think, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the other part is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it's affected when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) in it, so when I multiply it by any term from the second expression, it will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expression will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). Therefore, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I might need to sum over all the terms in the second expression. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and when multiplied by any term in the second expression, it will have additional factors. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that might not make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, I need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to consider all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum their coefficients across all possible powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that's not exactly right because each term in the second part has its own coefficient, so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to sum over all possible \\(k\\) in the second expression. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down more clearly.\n\nFirst, let's consider \\((a + b)^4\\). As I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^{k}\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit tricky because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\)? Or is there a specific power of \\(c\\) we're supposed to consider? Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it means the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, essentially, we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for any \\(k\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think my approach is correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of all those products. But in that case, since each term in the product is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expression, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by the sum of all terms in the other polynomial. So, yes, that would make sense. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me write out the product: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second sum, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the coefficients in the second polynomial are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), the sum of these coefficients is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me think about this. \n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms from the second expansion because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms, you'll get terms with higher or lower powers of a and b, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms won't contribute to the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. Suppose I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion will just give me \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite correct because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is also a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, when you multiply the two expansions together, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all variables. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions in variables. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). Let me think about that.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the variables are independent. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is... Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate expansion, so when you multiply the two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but no, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables together, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would still be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expansion. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, another approach: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the terms in the second polynomial don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But again, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables as independent, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine. Wait, no, because the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone (without any \\(c\\) terms) would be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) in the second expansion. Wait, that might be it.\n\nWait, hold on. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc., then when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) doesn't exist in the product because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) unless it's included.\n\nWait, let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term when you expand it. Let me calculate that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To get a constant term, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), and that's the only term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, I might have thought the coefficient was just 6, but since the second expansion contributes a constant term, it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But only the constant term in the second part (which is 20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the second part will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term without any \\(c\\) is \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Hmm, but wait, no, the entire expression is multiplied together, so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will affect the overall coefficient when combined with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the other part as a constant multiplier.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, the terms can combine in various ways. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can find the coefficient in each part separately and then multiply them together, assuming that the other variables don't interfere. Let me think. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the two parts are multiplied together, so the \\(c\\) terms would multiply with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by 1 in that specific term, meaning that the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in the product would be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by each term from the second part, each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but only if the term from the second part is a constant, i.e., doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but the product would involve terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), which suggests that perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to some power. But since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), maybe it's considering all possible powers, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, which would be 1. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can proceed as follows. First, I'll find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, so to get the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial, because any other combination would result in a different exponent for \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product.\n\nNow, I think the key here is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will come from the product of the terms in each expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will give me some terms involving c and 1/c. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c. That seems a bit confusing. How can a term involving c affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate expansions, one in a and b, and another in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them together, the variables a, b, c are all separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some term from the other expansion that doesn't involve a or b, right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving c, that would give me a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that any term involving c wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, no, let me correct that. Actually, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms that are products of the two. But since a, b, and c are different variables, the only way a term in the product can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't involve a or b, which is any term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the c expansion, the coefficient adds up.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think again. No, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by each term, you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the c expansion.\n\nBut wait, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting c = 1, because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, plugging c = 1 into \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the c expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (from the sum of coefficients in the c expansion), giving 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you have two separate variables, the terms involving a and b are independent of c. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the c expansion, each time adding a coefficient. So, yes, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the c expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c. So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the a and b part times the sum of all coefficients from the c part, because each term in the c part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables are separate, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by any term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 (from the first polynomial) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in every term where it's multiplied by any term from the c expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the sum of coefficients in the c expansion is indeed 64. Let me compute that again. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting c = 1 gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because sometimes, when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since the variables are separate, the coefficients just multiply.\n\nWait, for example, suppose I have (P(a,b)) * (Q(c)). Then, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be (coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a,b)) * (sum of coefficients in Q(c)), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by a^2b^2. So, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me try a smaller example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding (a + b)^2 gives a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The expansion of (c + 1/c)^1 is c + 1/c. Now, the product would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because there's no a^2b^2 term. Wait, that's different. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, in this smaller example, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c), which when expanded, the terms are a^2c, a^2*(1/c), 2abc, 2ab*(1/c), b^2c, b^2*(1/c). So, none of these terms are a^2b^2, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my previous reasoning, the coefficient of a^2 in (a + b)^2 is 1, and the sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^1 is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, my initial reasoning is incorrect because in this smaller example, the coefficient isn't 1 * 2 = 2, it's zero. So, what's the mistake here?\n\nAh, I see. The mistake is that in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\) and not in the c expansion, but when you multiply by the c terms, you don't get \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by c terms, which introduces other variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, or is it considering the entire expression as a single polynomial and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any c terms?\n\nWait, in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no term without c. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because all terms in the product will have c terms attached to them, so there's no pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the original problem, the c terms are separate, so when you multiply, you can have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any c term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if the c terms multiply to 1, i.e., when the exponent of c is zero.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nIn the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, you'll have terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - n}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is consistent, so \\(k = 2\\). Now, the exponent of c in such terms must be zero for the term to be just \\(a^2b^2\\), because otherwise, it would have an extra factor of c or 1/c.\n\nSo, to get a term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(m - n = 0\\), which implies \\(m = n\\). But since \\(m + n = 6\\), this would mean \\(m = n = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = c^0 = 1\\).\n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^3 \\times (1/c)^3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 3} \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times c^{-3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the c expansion is 20, and the coefficient from the a and b expansion is 6, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the smaller example I tried earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no c^0 term in the c expansion. Because in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the terms are c and 1/c, so no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nSo, in the original problem, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the sum of coefficients was 64, but that's only when you set c = 1, which gives the sum of all coefficients. But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present when the c terms multiply to give c^0, which is 1. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of c^0 in the c expansion, not the sum of all coefficients. That was my mistake earlier.\n\nSo, to correct my initial approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be zero, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Simplifying the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so that means I need to consider how the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) interact with the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I can figure out which parts of the second expansion will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expression that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of each term in the product are the sums of the products of coefficients from the original polynomials where the exponents add up appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will just tag along with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a specific power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so it's the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer should be 120. Let me just verify that.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps they are considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would still be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them together to get 120. So, yes, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, I think the first interpretation is correct, that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. That seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120. So, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiplying them together.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me think about that. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) should be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, the entire expression is multiplied together, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in the second part, because any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I can treat the second part as a constant when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right either because when you multiply two expressions, each term from one is multiplied by each term from the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two expressions, say, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\), but that's the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would be different. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Let me check that approach. \n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Alternatively, I can compute it using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\text{(term from } (a + b)^4) \\times \\text{(term from } (c + 1/c)^6)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but without any specific power of \\(c\\). But that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would remain 6, and the rest would be part of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by 6. But that's not a single numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) part because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which isn't standard. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient would include any factors from the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually with respect to a single variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me compute that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nWait, let me check: in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 120, assuming that the problem wants the coefficient when considering the entire product and only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of \\(c\\). But I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in the expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all terms from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignores the second part because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems inconsistent because the entire expression is the product of both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but without any specific power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) instead of \\((a + b)^4\\). But no, the problem is as given. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible because 120 is a number, and it's a standard problem to find the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expansions. \n\nLet me confirm that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. But since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's intended to include all powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a red herring. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just there to confuse. But that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, let me check some references. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expansions, it's considering the term in the product where the variables match. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other expansion is in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, ignoring the second. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes sense because it's a standard problem where you're asked to find the coefficient of a specific term in a product of expansions, considering all variables. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's intended to include all powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should compute both possibilities. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused. But given that the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct. \n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. So, multiplying them gives 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, so I might need to multiply by something from the second part. However, let me think: since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, which is only in terms of \\(c\\), does that mean that when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first part, any term involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part would actually be separate. But the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, unless the second part contributes to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which it doesn't, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a coefficient, and the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient in the product will be the sum of all those coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then when I multiply it by each term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term that comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion will have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of it, but with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it just adds a factor of that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c^k\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's essentially asking for the sum of all coefficients attached to \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait another thought: maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). When multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with coefficient 6, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6 from the first expansion, each term becomes \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(6\\). As before, the sum is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm misapplying the binomial theorem. The second term is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first expansion, the product will have terms \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in Q(c), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when we set c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 times (c + 1/c)^1. Then, (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Now, the product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). If I look for the coefficient of a^2, it would be a^2 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of a^2 is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because when c=1, (c + 1/c) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of ab would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of b^2 would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of each term in the first polynomial are multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2. So, in our original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's correct that it's 6 times 64. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire second polynomial, so the coefficient of that term in the product is the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that's consistent with the example I just did.\n\nWait, but another way: suppose I think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\cdot \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote the first part as P and the second part as Q. So, P = (a + b)^4 and Q = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product is P * Q. When I expand P, I get terms like a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, etc. When I expand Q, I get terms like c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}. Now, when I multiply P and Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, for the term 6a^2b^2 in P, when multiplied by each term in Q, it becomes 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2 * 6c^4, 6a^2b^2 * 15c^2, 6a^2b^2 * 20, 6a^2b^2 * 15c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2 * 6c^{-4}, and 6a^2b^2c^{-6}. So, each of these terms has a coefficient, and the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product would be the sum of all these coefficients, because each term is a different power of c, but all have a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. That's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm that the sum of coefficients in Q is indeed 64. Since Q is (c + 1/c)^6, the sum of coefficients is when c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the sum of the coefficients in Q manually. The coefficients are: 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of it another way. Suppose I didn't consider the entire sum, but instead thought about the term a^2b^2 in P and how it combines with Q. Since Q is independent of a and b, every term in Q will just multiply the a^2b^2 term, contributing their coefficients. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times any term in the other polynomial contributes to the coefficient of that specific term in the product. So, in this case, since a^2b^2 doesn't involve c, every term in Q will contribute to the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product, each multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that I didn't make any miscalculations. Let's compute 6 * 64. 6 * 60 is 360, and 6 * 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. That's correct.\n\nSo, after considering multiple approaches and verifying each step, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Calculating the coefficients, that becomes \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the other part of the product involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), maybe those terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that any term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms would still count towards the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), those terms would be like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if it's multiplied by a constant term from the second polynomial, meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). From earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here, but just to be thorough, let me think again. When multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for terms that are like terms. In this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and \\(c^0\\) is a term in the second. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the \\(c^0\\) term is a constant, their product is just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant, which is 120. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? I think so, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial multiplies each term from the second polynomial. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum from the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. The entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). But when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the variables. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the product, every term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by a term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that coefficient by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in.\n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I considered the sum of all coefficients. Instead, I should have only considered the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term without \\(c\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any errors. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I correctly identified that in order to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. Multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is needed to combine with \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing \\(c\\)) has a coefficient of 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that first. \n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar (it doesn't involve \\(c\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in that part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will indeed be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by 64, the total coefficient becomes 6 * 64. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in any polynomial \\(P(c)\\) is \\(P(1)\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we have \\(1 + 1/1 = 2\\), and then \\(2^6 = 64\\). That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, I could expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^m c^{-m}\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's a different approach. \n\nWait, so if I think about the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then in the second part, I need the term that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nWait, so then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, and now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? \n\nLet me clarify. The first approach was that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. The second approach was that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWhich one is correct? \n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the first approach. The first approach assumes that every term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in reality, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nBut wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But in the second approach, I thought of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. Which is correct? Let me think about this carefully. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term in the second part, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get a term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^{-6}\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if there's a term in the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making it not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because only the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part would result in a term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The first approach was incorrect because I thought that the entire sum of coefficients in the second part would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but in reality, only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to clarify, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me expand the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), giving 64, but that approach was incorrect because it's not the sum that affects \\(a^2b^2\\), but rather the specific term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar, so when you multiply it by Q(c), you get \\(a^2b^2 * Q(c)\\), which would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the constant term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c). \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider specific terms. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20c^{0}\\), so the coefficient is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, I get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut if I consider other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), like \\(c^6\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I was mistakenly considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, and multiplying that by 6. But that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second part, which is not the case. \n\nSo, the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's think about the entire product. \n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThe product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). \n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6a^2b^2. \n\nWhen multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, resulting in terms like 6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in Q(c))}\\). \n\nBut we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear if the term from \\(Q(c)\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from P) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), which is 20. \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nI think I initially confused myself by considering the sum of all coefficients, but upon further reflection, it's clear that only the constant term in Q(c) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me try expanding that first.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But wait, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) come from the first part, and then when I multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can separate the two parts.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I think that only the term where the power of \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Otherwise, if we have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that would be a different term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. All other terms involving \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\) would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the overall \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them different variables. So, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the product of the 6 and 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product can only combine in such a way that each variable's exponents come from their respective polynomials. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial doesn't interact with the \\(c\\) terms except through multiplication, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat them as separate parts. Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider the entire product. That is, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should figure out whether the multiplication with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the terms from each expression multiply together. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I will get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Or is it possible that the problem is considering all terms, including those with \\(c\\)? Hmm, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Or perhaps, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But if the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, then it's a different calculation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it might mean the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's see. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But now I'm confused because depending on how I interpret the problem, I get two different answers: 384 and 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's written, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might just be the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term usually refers to the coefficient when considering all other variables as constants. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion's coefficients. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems more plausible because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a single number. So, maybe the correct answer is 120. Let me verify this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. The term \\(c^0\\) in the second part comes with coefficient 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) has coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider both expansions. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) at all. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion? But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the other terms? Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does that mean I need to consider the part of the second expansion that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second expansion. But no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's only considering the part with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, from the first part. But wait, let me make sure. Let me try to write out the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get the product of each term from the first expansion and each term from the second expansion. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. So, that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to consider all possible terms in its expansion. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that every term from the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times 2^6\\), since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Wait, but that seems off because I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. But that seems too simple. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to various terms involving \\(c\\), each term will be multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like \\(6c^k\\), \\(6c^{k-1}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively adding 6 times each coefficient of the second expansion to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384. But I want to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we do this, we get multiple terms, each of which has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and we're summing their coefficients, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in this case, each of those terms from the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), as each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the sum of binomial coefficients is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Let me think about how the multiplication works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and its coefficient is 6. Now, when I multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), the resulting coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to sum all these coefficients for all possible \\(m\\). That is, sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is 6 times the sum from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(m = 6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that first. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, so maybe I should first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. Using the binomial theorem again, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply the two expansions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I'm essentially taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) in them. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of each such term would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). That doesn't seem right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the expansion, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify it another way. Alternatively, I can think that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and it's being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. And the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found earlier. So, 6 * 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient should be 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-m}\\) or something? No, that's not quite right. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) term, each with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum from \\(m=0\\) to \\(m=6\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that confirms it again.

That means I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the second expression doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant factor with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. But wait, that's not correct because the second expression is multiplied as a whole, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me consider that when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients in the product are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part doesn't get multiplied by any terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because those are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. Wait, but actually, no. Because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you get \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in second expression) times \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not quite right either because the sum of the coefficients in the second expression is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps I should just take 6 and that's it. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would contribute to the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only combine with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if you multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is what contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider the entire product. Now, I'm a bit confused about how to approach this because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, right? The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply them together, how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nLet me think.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if we take any other term from the second expression, it would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlright, so how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Let's do that: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, plugging \\(k = 3\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20 because \\(6 \\times 5 \\times 4 / 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 / 6 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.

Since these are multiplied together in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, other terms could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if there's a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's not constant, but when multiplied by some term from \\((a + b)^4\\), could it somehow result in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, but since the other terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have exponents of \\(c\\), unless those exponents are zero, they would introduce \\(c\\) terms. So, unless the other term is also multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) exponent, but in this case, since we're only considering the product of the two expressions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct.

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Now, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if \\(a\\) has an exponent of 2, then \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that binomial coefficient.\n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure how this relates yet because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient I found for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, maybe. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might not affect it. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems too simple, so I'm probably missing something.\n\nWait, no, maybe the problem is that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply out, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), perhaps? Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion would contribute differently.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient for each occurrence. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each occurrence would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible coefficients from the other part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the expansion would be something like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), so perhaps the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), the sum of coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that might not be accurate because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems to be the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as two separate polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by each coefficient in the second part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller exponent to see if this approach is correct. Let's say instead of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\), so the coefficient would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 times 2. But if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = 2\\), so the coefficients would be 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother test: \\((a + b)^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, the product would be each term in the first multiplied by each term in the second. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2), so the coefficient is 1 times the sum of coefficients, which is 1*(1 + 2 + 1) = 4. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is 2 times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2), so 2*4 = 8. And the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1 times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2), so 4. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 4, which is 1*(sum of coefficients of the second expansion). So, this approach seems valid.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, for the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the sum of the coefficients as the evaluation of the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which is exactly what I did. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product really just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial times any term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of that specific term in the product. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be combined with different powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and you can't combine those into a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let's adjust my approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the constant term in that expansion. So, how do I find that?\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were including all coefficients from the second expansion, which isn't the case if we're only looking for the \\(c^0\\) term. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not considering that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, not just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by everything else.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but in the context of all variables, so perhaps it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, then multiply them together to get 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a smaller exponent to make sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 0 because the expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so there's no constant term. Wait, but that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. But if I were to look for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be 1 times the entire second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps in the original problem, the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which might be ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we need to sum over all possible coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. But that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, and that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would not be a numerical coefficient but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which is a bit confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the coefficient can be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended that we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but the coefficient is a numerical value, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems inconsistent with standard terminology because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and \\(c\\) is a constant, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have all variables combined, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check the expansion again. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the other parts? Or do I? Wait, no, because when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not right either because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are the same as the binomial coefficients, but each term is multiplied by \\(c^{6 - k}\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) or something like that. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are actually the binomial coefficients, but each term has a variable part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it. But that can't be right because the entire expression is multiplied by the other binomial. Hmm, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they become part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term, but the coefficients would add up. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I sum all the coefficients in the second expansion, that would be 64, as I calculated before. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, since the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with coefficients that sum up to 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by other variables. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the two expansions:**\n   When multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Specifically, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\n4. **Determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\):**\n   Since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we need to sum the coefficients from all terms in the second expansion.

    "text": " Let me think about expanding that.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I have to consider the entire expression, including the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it just the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Hmm, I think it's the entire expression, so I need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But wait, actually, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(c\\) part might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, you're essentially taking each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the product will have terms that are products of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nHowever, the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything, but they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. However, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts independently. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate expansion. But when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't change the variables when multiplied. Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(Q(c)\\), because that's the only term in \\(Q(c)\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, it's the only term that doesn't introduce any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two parts are independent (one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first and 20 from the second, giving 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. That means I have to multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I don't need to expand everything. Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can focus only on the terms that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the other expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms from the second expansion that don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can be ignored. But actually, no, that's not quite right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but the variables are separate. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient in the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that seems confusing.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar; it's a sum of terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), or maybe it's just asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. Hmm, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and we need the sum of the coefficients for all such terms. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Wait, no, perhaps it's just treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) multiply to \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar multiple. But that doesn't seem right because it's an expression, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expansion. That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, I think that's the correct interpretation.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we can proceed as follows. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately using the binomial theorem, then multiply the corresponding terms and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nSo, let's start with \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, let's look at \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, we can write out the expansion:\n\n- For \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- For \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20c^0 = 20\\)\n- For \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find all combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\nLooking at the first expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by terms from the second expansion, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. From the second expansion, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, we get \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Let me check. The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only term in the second expansion that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is 20. All other terms have positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, yes, the only contribution is from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering the \\(c\\) terms, is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that another term from the first expansion, when multiplied by a term from the second expansion, could result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? For example, suppose we take a term like \\(4a^3b\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term like \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion. Then, \\(4a^3b \\times c^{-1}\\) would give \\(4a^3bc^{-1}\\), which doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, any other term from the first expansion would have different exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, they won't result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the 20 from the second expansion, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. The coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by expanding each part using the binomial theorem and identifying the relevant terms. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nThe term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nMultiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) by the \\(c^0\\) term (20) gives:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
