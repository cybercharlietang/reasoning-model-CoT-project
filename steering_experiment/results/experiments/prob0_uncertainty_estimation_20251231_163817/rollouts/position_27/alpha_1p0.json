So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, I considered that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Since the second part has a \\(c\\) term, any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore those. So, yes, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, each term would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). For this to be \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's correct. And for the \\(c\\) part, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, \\(c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the coefficient for \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to think about it another way, the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, any term in the product will be a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. Since we're only interested in the term where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and the \\(c\\) terms are canceled out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient is just the product of the respective coefficients from each expansion. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
