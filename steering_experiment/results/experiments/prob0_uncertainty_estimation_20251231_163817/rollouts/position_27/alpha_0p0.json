    "text": " 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on the second part. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, and since these are independent, their coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6 \\times a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(20 \\times 1\\), so the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the terms in the expansion are products of terms from each part. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we must take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term from the second part. Any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the entire term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, that confirms that the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients I found earlier, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct: 4 choose 2 is 6, and 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - Find the constant term (exponent 0) by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k}y^k\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So, the expansion will be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Let me simplify each term: \\(c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(2k = 6\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me compute that coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients I found. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.

So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) => \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.
