    "text": " Now, let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the \\(c^0\\) term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is at \\(m=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way: the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions, so when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to take the term where the second part contributes a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Let's consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form (term from first expansion) * (term from second expansion). So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we must take the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem logical.
