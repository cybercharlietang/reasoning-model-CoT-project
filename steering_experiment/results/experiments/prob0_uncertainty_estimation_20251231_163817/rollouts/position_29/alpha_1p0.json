Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term, but we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would ignore any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, that's not correct. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times \\(Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that's not the case. Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\(P(a, b)\\) and a term from \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(Q(c)\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term in \\(Q(c)\\), like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Alternatively, I could expand both parts separately and then look for the coefficient. But that might be more work. Alternatively, I could consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the same as before. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. That's correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is indeed 120. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, we need to consider the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider different terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the exponents. Let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), \\(m = 3\\), which gives the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). I think that's the right answer.\n\nJust to recap: I used the binomial theorem on both parts, found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, found the constant term in the second part, and then multiplied them together. So, the final coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
