So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. When you multiply these together, you get 6*20=120. That seems right. But let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6*20=120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in this case, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product without involving \\(c\\) terms. For example, if the second polynomial had a term with \\(c\\) and another term with \\(1/c\\), maybe their product would give a \\(c^0\\) term, but in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) for some k, but when multiplied by the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) term, any term with a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems correct. So, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expression, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other term from the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the product would include those variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms don't contribute.

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term?

But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). Any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\).
