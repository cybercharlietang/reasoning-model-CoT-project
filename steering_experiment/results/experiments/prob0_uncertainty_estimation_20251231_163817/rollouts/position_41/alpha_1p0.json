    "text": " Is it correct to multiply them? Because in the product of the two expressions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by the constant term in the second expression, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120. But just to make sure, let me think of another way. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and when looking for a specific term, you need to find all combinations of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, it must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because any term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, which would make the term have a \\(c\\) part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part has to be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, yeah, that's why we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients seem correct: 6 choose 2 is 15? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, earlier, I said that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. But wait, let me check that again. The binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. So, that's correct. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I didn't use this method, maybe I could expand both expressions and multiply them, but that would be more time-consuming and prone to errors. So, I think the method I used is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in the other expansion is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So yes, that seems right. So, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) indeed 20? Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) a bit to see if that makes sense. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = 20 c^0\\), which is correct. So, that seems right. So, the coefficient is indeed 20. Therefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, but wait, is there another way this could be approached? Maybe considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler because the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply this by each term in the other expansion, you get terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * c^k, where k varies. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to have \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (c^0) in the second part. Because if you multiply by any other term in the second part, which has a positive or negative power of \\(c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me think of another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or considering the entire expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider how the coefficients multiply. But I think the approach I took earlier is correct. Let me just recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me check the calculations again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
