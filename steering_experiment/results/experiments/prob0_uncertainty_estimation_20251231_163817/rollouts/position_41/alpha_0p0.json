So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but only the constant term in the second polynomial will result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).
