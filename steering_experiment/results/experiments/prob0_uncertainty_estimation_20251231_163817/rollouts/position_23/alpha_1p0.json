    "text": " Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term that has \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so it doesn't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, let me try that approach. First, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, if I take a term with \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by a term from the second expansion, could that result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, only if the exponents from the first part are exactly 2 for both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, if I take any other term from the first expansion, say \\(a^3b^1\\), and multiply it by something from the second expansion, that would give me \\(a^3b^1 \\times c^m\\) or something, which would not be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, will give me \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second part will result in a term that has only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second part will introduce some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my initial thought was correct: the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has a term with \\(c^0\\) when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, yes, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with coefficient 6 and a term \\(c^0\\) from the second part with coefficient 20, then when I multiply them, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\).

So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.\n\nOkay, so let's first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we want the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by the entire other polynomial would just be the coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of the other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But earlier, I thought it was 6 times 20, which is 120. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify. When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears only once, which is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, I think I was correct the first time. The coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me confirm this by another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by each term in the other, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're effectively summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems too large. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I expand it, I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would include all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) can be any integer. So, in this case, the coefficients are 6, 36, 90, 120, 90, 36, 6. Adding these up: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, the total coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems very high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem statement isn't clear on that. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials, usually, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible coefficients multiplied by different powers of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 120. Let me check my addition again: 6 + 36 is 42; 42 + 90 is 132; 132 + 120 is 252; 252 + 90 is 342; 342 + 36 is 378; 378 + 6 is 384. Yes, that's correct.\n\nBut now I'm really confused because I thought initially it was 120, but upon considering all the terms, it's 384. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Perhaps using generating functions or considering the product more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). Therefore, it's indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I said earlier, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be scaled by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P(a, b)\\). So, if \\(Q(c)\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term. But that was a mistake. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's the sum over all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with an example. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, we get:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product would be the sum of coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which are 1 and 1, so total coefficient is 2. But the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 1 times 2 is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would also be 2.\n\nSo, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product was 2, which is 1 times 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the constant term, but that was incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which includes all these terms. Therefore, the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm going back and forth between 120 and 384. Let me try to see if I can find another way to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem statement doesn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, so I think it's more accurate to interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of polynomials, typically means the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because in the simpler case, it worked out as 2, which was the coefficient times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying that logic here, it's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion, so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expression? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let me try to think of the entire product as a product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Now, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\times \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), because \\(4 - i = 2\\) implies \\(i = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) from \\(j=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Wait, no, that can't be right because the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in that expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible power of \\(c\\) from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms, so the coefficient is indeed 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Let me check that. So, if I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to take the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) which is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is the constant term, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{3} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes more sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. But earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all possible terms. But the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which equals 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we look for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which occurs at \\(j = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so it doesn't change the term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let's denote \\(d = c\\), so \\(\\left(d + \\dfrac{1}{d}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} d^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{d}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} d^{6 - 2m}\\).

Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and in the second part, the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.

So, when you multiply them, the only way to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should also check if there's another way to approach this problem, just to be thorough. For example, using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. But I think the approach I took is solid.

Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second polynomial? Let me think. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc., down to \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). But if you multiply, say, \\(a^3b\\) by \\(c^{-1}\\), you get \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^4\\) times \\(c^{-2}\\) would be \\(a^4 c^{-2}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that when you multiply other terms, you might accidentally get \\(a^2b^2\\) with some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so any terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c\\) to some power would be separate terms, not \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\) contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, yeah, I think I was correct earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But only when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) does it result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other multiplications would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nBut wait, let me just compute the entire product to make sure. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) first. It's \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^5 \\times 1/c + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 20a^2b^2\\), and so on. So, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by 20, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this might be to consider the entire expansion and see if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear. For instance, could there be a cross term where \\(a^3b\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by something from the second polynomial that somehow gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? But no, because when you multiply \\(a^3b\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you'll still have \\(a^3b\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which won't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, \\(a^4\\) times any term will give \\(a^4\\) times some power of \\(c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that can contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think I've convinced myself that the answer is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's multiplied by a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\) but still results in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the \\(c^0\\) term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would introduce some power of \\(c\\), which would make the product term have variables involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, those other terms wouldn't contribute. So, I think my earlier reasoning is correct.\n\nJust to recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
