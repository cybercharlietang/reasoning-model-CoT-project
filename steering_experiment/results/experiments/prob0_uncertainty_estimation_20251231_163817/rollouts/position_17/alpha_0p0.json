    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will just be multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact. Wait, actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I think that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the only way to get a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion), so 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is there any other way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) that might involve \\(c\\) terms? For example, could there be a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(c\\) that somehow cancels out? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\), so any term involving \\(c\\) would not be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the other expansion. So, the final coefficient should indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I can just find the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and that's it? Wait, no, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect it because they're separate variables. Wait, but that seems confusing. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form (coefficient from first part) \\(\\times\\) (coefficient from second part) \\(\\times a^k b^m c^n\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Because when you multiply by the second part, it's just a constant factor in front, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is not a constant. It's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the entire expression would have terms involving \\(c\\), but when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) which is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we only take the 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me just check my calculations again to be sure. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yes, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times 6, which is 120.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, every term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not the case because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. Wait, no, actually, each term in the product is a combination of terms from each polynomial.

So, in other words, we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and each of those terms will have a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think differently. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. But that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make much sense either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) depend on the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense if the problem is looking for a constant term in \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a single number, so maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's unlikely what the problem is asking. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will just be along for the ride, but they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't appear in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient just gets multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial? Or perhaps not. Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial, if any. Wait, let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term in the second polynomial that would contribute to a term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, only the constant term would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, without any \\(c\\) involved. All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) exponents, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just check if that makes sense. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the term without \\(c\\), or maybe the term that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that would be the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6 * 20 = 120 times \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems right. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all terms in the second part, but we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that contradicts my earlier answer of 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that \\(c^m\\) comes from the expansion. But we are only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient for this is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the entire product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). So, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me think differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. In this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the context of polynomials with multiple variables, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\), it typically includes all possible coefficients from other variables. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0, i.e., the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the correct answer would be 384. Wait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I look for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems specify that they want the term independent of other variables, but in this case, they didn't. So, I think 384 is the right answer. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But that's the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 64, giving 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would require the \\(c\\) terms to cancel out. But that would mean that we're looking for terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's approach it that way. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, how do we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me think. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under a different interpretation. So, which one is correct? I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, because if you don't consider \\(c\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the other expression, which include various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the context of the entire product would imply that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, but this would be the coefficient if we set \\(c = 1\\), which isn't the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But that's only when \\(c = 1\\), not in the general case. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm confused now. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges such that in the second term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k'\\) for \\(k'\\) from 0 to 6. Wait, no, that's not accurate. Actually, in \\((a + b)^4\\), each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 4. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k'}\\) for \\(k'\\) from 0 to 6. So, when you multiply the two, each term is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2k'}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is fixed. Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2k'\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(k'\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k'}\\) multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2k'}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{k'=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k'}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k'=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k'} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems to be the case only if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in reality, each term in the product has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), that is, as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct? Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. In polynomial terms, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a monomial like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically include all the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have those exponents, regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum all those coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, if we don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, this seems a bit counterintuitive because when you have multiple variables, typically, the coefficient of a specific monomial would require the exponents of the other variables to be zero. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. But wait, let me check this with a smaller example to see if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of coefficients when considering \\(c\\), then it would be \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but the sum of coefficients (setting \\(c = 1\\)) would be 2. So, perhaps in the original problem, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if we don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). Wait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a function of \\(c\\). So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). So, it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is that entire expression, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in polynomial terms, typically refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still unsure because in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of a specific monomial (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) would only include the term where the exponents of all variables match, which in this case would require \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 120. Let me try to clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2k'}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(k'\\) in the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k'}\\) will have a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k'}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(k'\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{k'}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k'}\\) for \\(k' = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? I think the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In standard polynomial terminology, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific monomial, you're referring to the term where all the exponents match exactly. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120. Wait, but in the smaller example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm still not sure. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\). That is, I treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'm going to go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only affected by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every possible term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is just multiplied by the entire expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can range from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, right? Because each term is either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds more variables, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be 6 times whatever. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only determined by the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, when multiplied by any term in the second expression, it would just carry the coefficient from the second expression. But that's not correct because the coefficient is a scalar; it doesn't involve variables. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\), but that's not quite right. Wait, no, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part (\\(6\\)) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not the case because the coefficient is a scalar. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the other polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should just be a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the product. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both polynomials, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is part of the product. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would require considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product's coefficient would be scaled by the sum of the \\(c\\) coefficients. Wait, let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be because the coefficient is a scalar. I think I'm confusing myself here. Let me try another approach. Let me first expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, so the coefficient is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply polynomials, each term's coefficient is affected by the other polynomial's coefficients. Wait, perhaps the key here is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. Let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, when I multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the combined coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That makes sense now. I think I was confused earlier by considering the entire expansion, but since we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we only need to consider that specific term in the second expansion. Therefore, the final coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by 20, giving 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying 6 by 20, so yes, 120 is the coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we find \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Wait, but actually, no, because the variables are different. \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. Wait, no, that's not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply 6 by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus contributes to the coefficient. Wait, but that's not quite accurate. Actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the other factor, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the concept here. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) variables, that would require that the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part contributes a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term. Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0 = 1\\), then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, so let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that's not possible because each term would have a different power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would mean summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (1 + 1)^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, this interpretation is likely incorrect.\n\nSecond interpretation: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In this case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\n3. We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors involving \\(c\\) won't affect that coefficient.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms that are combinations of \\(a^2b^2\\) and whatever terms come from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve both parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \"something\" is, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is expecting a numerical answer, I think. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, so it's 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as another variable, and the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're considering all variables. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the two expansions. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all variables. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is expecting a numerical answer, perhaps it's a misinterpretation, and the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's the answer. However, given that the problem includes both parts, I think the intended answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, if it's considering the constant term in the second expansion, it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms in the second expression will just contribute a factor, but not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial has terms only involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms only involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. But wait, actually, no. Because each term in the second part is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, that term will only be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the overall term have a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), thus changing the exponent of \\(c\\), but not affecting the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then we need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct approach is to take the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I expand both parts fully. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is only the term where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, which is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then it would be 6 * 15 = 90, because the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion is 15. But in this case, since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using binomial theorem. The constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term. So, let me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, that's why it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just confirm that I didn't overlook anything. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, so when I multiply 6 by 20, I get 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.

When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.

For example, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(...\\right)\\), then each term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this by considering a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2.

So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(6c^4a^2b^2\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second expansion because otherwise, you'd have other variables attached. So, the only term in the second expansion that would give a constant when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me verify. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). When I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times c^6 a^2b^2\\), \\(6 \\times 6c^4 a^2b^2\\), etc. But the problem is only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. That can only happen if the second factor contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part's constant term), which equals 120. So, the final coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, first, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I considered that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (which is 20) would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) involved. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes directly from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms can be anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, to find that, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found as 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is a separate variable, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which has various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I correctly determined that the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Yeah, that makes sense.

But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a series of terms involving \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a term that also involves specific powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire second expansion.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in that case, I would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, it might just be 6, but perhaps it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. Hmm, maybe I should consider that. Let me see. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, so I think I initially missed that the problem might be implying that the coefficient should include the constant term from the second expansion. So, the final answer is 120.

But actually, that's not the case because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that's impossible because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then the second part is just a separate expansion, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. When you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is independent of the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a single coefficient; it's more like a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make sense because then it's a specific term in the entire expansion. So, if that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that assumption. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we have to consider the product and find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, which is a polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the other part. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the entire expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, as I thought earlier, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. So, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second part, but that would be if we were summing over all \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But then again, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. Since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \"in\" the product, so perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is not a single number but a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a single number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure. Let me see if I can find another way to interpret the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Therefore, the only way the problem makes sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems contradictory because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I'm a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is 120, considering that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Therefore, I'll go with 120 as the coefficient.\n\nWait, but to clarify, when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product, it's referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a single coefficient, perhaps it's referring to the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Given that, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But that seems too high, and it's a single number, so maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, if we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it must be a specific term, so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) because we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, actually, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that term will be present in the product with the coefficient we found, multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then note that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems a bit off. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) don't interfere with each other in terms of variable exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial, and since we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Now, let me find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), so the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, when you multiply these two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second polynomial adds a coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can expand each part separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, as we saw. So, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the \\(c\\) terms could affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since they're separate variables, they don't. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only multiplied by the coefficients from the other expansion, not the variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
