    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe the other part just gets multiplied by 1? Or perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficients multiply, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when multiplied, will contribute some terms in \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the coefficient as 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the 6, and when we collect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients of the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but maybe I'm wrong because the second part might not just contribute a scalar; perhaps each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the variables, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would just contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the other part as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, I'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which is a product of two expressions. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) part, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I need to clarify: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems more reasonable. So, let me proceed with that approach. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I want the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (along with \\(c^0\\)) is 120. But the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily specifying anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, that's confusing. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem likely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think the intended interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the answer is 120. Alternatively, if they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems less likely. Since the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's a product of two expressions, so when you expand it, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what they want. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what power of \\(c\\) it's multiplied by. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe that's what the problem is asking for. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as we found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer is 120. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since the two parts are multiplied together, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But since the second part is a sum, each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that seems too big. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, so the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), so that the term is a pure number. That is, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typically what such problems ask for. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then I need to consider both parts: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second part. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I think it's 384. But now I'm confused because in typical problems, when you have multiple variables, they usually specify the term they want, including all variables. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1)^0\\), then it's just \\((a + b)^2\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 2. So, in that case, it's clear. But when the second part is non-constant, it's more complicated. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by other terms, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, perhaps that's the answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to clarify: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in the second polynomial, i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), so that the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more reasonable because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical in such problems. So, I think the intended answer is 120. Therefore, I'll go with 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Next, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expression, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, is that the case? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for that term would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D + E + F + G + H + ...\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = M + N + O + P + Q + R + ...\\), then when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other terms don't affect it. So, yes, I think 6 times 64 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm if that's accurate. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\) times \\((1 + 1) = 2\\), so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times 2, so 4. And the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, so 2. So, in that case, the coefficients are indeed multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other polynomial. So, yes, that approach seems correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's a product of two expressions, and we need the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product is a sum of terms, each of which is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by the \\(c\\) terms; it's just 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that can't be, because the coefficient is a scalar. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). Wait, that might make sense. Because if we're considering the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and if we want the term where \\(c^k\\) is a specific power, say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to compute that. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply the two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I need to consider that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial. But that seems incorrect because the coefficient is supposed to be a number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) is determined by the second expansion. But we are only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), i.e., \\(k = 2\\). So, for each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each coefficient becomes part of the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm correct because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term in the product, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6*64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is in the second factor, so it's separate. Wait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first factor, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 1 (from \\(c \\times 1/c = 1\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 1 = 1. But if I just take the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is 1, and multiply by the entire second expansion, I get \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. So, that approach doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would require considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, because each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems to make sense because each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the correct answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem statement doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I think the intended answer is 384. Let me confirm by expanding both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), not just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6*64 = 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.

But that seems off because the entire expression is a product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6.

The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Each of these terms will be of the form \\(k \\times a^2b^2 \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each coefficient \\(k\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as 6, but that would be the case if the second part were 1, but since it's raised to the 6th power, it's 64. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the problem again: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. Since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for each such term is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the second part, and just took the coefficient from the first part, it would be 6, but since the second part is multiplied by the first, the coefficient is scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nI think that's the right approach. So, the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me think. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 64 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, so 64 * 6 = 384. So, that seems plausible. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem just asks for the coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the multiplication by the other expansion would scale the coefficient. Wait, no, because the other expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as 1, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the other expansion affects the coefficient. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical value, implying that we should set \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, which would give us 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's it. But that seems too simple. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that's the answer. But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) suggests that it's more involved. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2 respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because then we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me think about that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and we need to multiply it by the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that seems more reasonable. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that the overall term is just a constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me recap: To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we need to multiply this by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought about setting \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, which gave me 64, and then 6 * 64 = 384. But now, with this approach, I get 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that the coefficient is a constant. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Or do I? Wait, actually, maybe I should consider how the two parts interact. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, I think the second part's expansion would just contribute a factor, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the value from the second part is just 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's only in terms of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expression. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a single term, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, but only the coefficient part, not the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm confused. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't seem right because the second expression is a sum of terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Because if you have, say, \\(c^k\\) multiplied by \\(1/c^k\\), that would give a constant term. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Okay, let me try that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to consider only the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\), i.e., the constant term. So, that's why we found the constant term in the second part and multiplied it by 6. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, resulting in 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have multiple terms, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps all the terms in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., have \\(c^0\\), because only those will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

Wait, but hold on, is that all? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, and the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a constant term, which is 20, then yes, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6*20=120. That makes sense.

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how this term interacts with the other expression. But actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), right? Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\) in terms of exponents. So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the other expansion, the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term will be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can sum over all possible \\(k\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be accurate because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first, so the coefficients would be multiplied, not just summed. Let me clarify. Let's denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\text{Coeff}_A \\times \\text{Coeff}_B \\times a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\). So, for each term in \\(A\\), we multiply it by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in cross terms. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) would be the sum over all terms in \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is a single term, when multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term in } B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each such term is the product of the coefficients from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(B\\) because each term in \\(B\\) contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\(A\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A \\times B\\) is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). So, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. Earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\(A \\times B\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense. Because if I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, that will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, I can use the binomial expansion. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). We want the exponent \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), so solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As we found earlier, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. Which one is correct? Let me clarify. The confusion arises because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But that would give 6 times 64, which is 384. However, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the power of \\(c\\), then 384 is correct. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But wait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expression, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times 64, as each term in the second expansion contributes to a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check again. Let me think of it differently. Let's consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Let's expand both expressions separately and then see how the coefficients combine. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{-6} = 1 \\times c^{-6}\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{2} = 15c^{2}\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{4} = 6c^{4}\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{6} = 1c^{6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for exponents -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6 respectively.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6 \\times 20a^2b^2c^{0}\\), \\(6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{2}\\), \\(6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{4}\\), and \\(6 \\times 1a^2b^2c^{6}\\). So, each of these terms has a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{0}\\) is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{2}\\) is 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{4}\\) is 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6}\\) is 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, because each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, adding them up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let's compute that step by step:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the addition:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), where the sum of all coefficients is 64 (found by substituting \\(c = 1\\)). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me think. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.

So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a single term when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will just contribute a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient in the entire expansion, including all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a scalar. Wait, but that's not correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is not a scalar; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but without specifying the power, so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a sum over all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a number, so perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can be any term, but since we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.

Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me verify this because I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by that, the entire coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me try a different approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is if you multiply by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Wait, but the problem didn't specify that the term should be free of \\(c\\), just that it should be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I think I'm missing something here. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. So, maybe the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let's calculate that. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c^0\\). Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that the term should be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify. Wait, but in the original problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in such a way that it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think that's incorrect because the coefficient of a term in a product is the product of the coefficients of the respective terms. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion. But then, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient gets multiplied by each term's coefficient, and then you sum them all up. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then that term is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, maybe I can treat it as 6 multiplied by the entire expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're not changing the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the other part. But actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, that's when you're multiplying two terms, but in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of a specific term in the product. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just multiplied by the entire expression, so its coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, so 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach because the question might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient, maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do multiply. So, maybe the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively multiplying by a sum of terms, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the term, but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and you multiply it by the entire second expression, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expression. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the right answer.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 64. Therefore, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in each part multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the only contribution is from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is separate. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the sum is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, this term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients of this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Or do I? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second part when it's multiplied by the first part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect that. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're essentially taking each term from the first expansion and multiplying it by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would introduce more variables. Wait, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. So, let me try that approach. So, first, I have the coefficient 6 from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficient from the first part (6) by the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term in the expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? I don't think so because any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's not the constant term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms would be excluded. So, yes, the only contribution comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).
