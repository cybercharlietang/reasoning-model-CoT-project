    "text": " Because when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables add their exponents. But in this case, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), the product terms will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can consider the coefficient as the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be something like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and this is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. No, actually, no. Let me clarify. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so each term in the expansion will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning just the coefficient part, treating \\(c\\) as constants. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include any terms multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me think again. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion. That would make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need this exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion. That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, I think that's the right approach. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, we get \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to think of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that they want the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is involved, so 120 is the correct answer. Therefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Or do I need to make sure that when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't being multiplied by something else? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, meaning that the expression is a product of two expansions, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But then, in that case, the \\(c\\) terms would affect the overall expression, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the terms from both expansions.

So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all variables. But that would require the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number, not an expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distractor. But that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6. But the problem includes both parts, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a separate part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term in the product would be a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just there to confuse me. Alternatively, maybe the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   The given expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

    "text": " Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms from each will combine. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I can just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, because each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will just add another factor, but since we're only looking for terms where the \\(c\\) parts don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but is that accurate? Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds up. So, that makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial? Well, the sum of coefficients is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), so the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you expand the entire expression, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or something like that, but the problem is only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), regardless of \\(n\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from the two parts. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is multiplied by that 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c\\) term. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression would have multiple terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^n\\) for any \\(n\\). So, that would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6, and the other part is irrelevant. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes both parts. So, perhaps I need to think differently. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial includes terms with \\(c\\), each of those will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. Let me check that again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is 64. So, when you multiply these two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\), that means we have to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by all these \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again. So, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in reasoning. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents on \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the possible exponents are \\(6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), each with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). And since the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is taken from the first part and any term from the second part. But since the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that's 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are indeed multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems to confirm the approach.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) when multiplied by Q(c) is the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, since Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe I should calculate the sum of coefficients in Q(c) more carefully. The sum of coefficients is when we set all variables to 1. So, in Q(c), substituting c = 1, we get \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute 6 * 64. 6 * 60 is 360, and 6 * 4 is 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\).

Because each term in the expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just the coefficient. So yes, that's correct.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so when I multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient in the entire product, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, I think it's considering the product of both expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

But that doesn't seem right either because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m - n}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is just \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, this term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20c^0, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when we multiply 6 by each of these terms, we get 6c^6, 36c^4, 90c^2, 120c^0, 90c^{-2}, 36c^{-4}, 6c^{-6}. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each corresponding term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each of those terms. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, which is 6*64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion, so each term would be 6 times the corresponding term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. So, for example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6*6 = 36, and so on. But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms. In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get 120a^2b^2. So, that seems more likely. Let me check that again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the number of \\(c\\)s equals the number of \\(1/c\\)s, which is when we choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term is 20c^0 = 20. So, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6, the combined coefficient is 6*20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term (i.e., the term without \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution to this term would come from the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^n\\), it would result in \\(a^2b^2c^n\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and correctly found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and correctly determined that to get the constant term, I needed to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(m = 3\\). Calculating that coefficient as 20. Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two separate products, say \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be the product of each term in the first expansion and each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Hmm, but that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two separate binomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), unless \\(k = 0\\), the term wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\); it would have some \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually means the coefficient when all other variables are considered as well. But in this case, the expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term because the exponents go from 6 down to -6. The middle term would be when the exponent is 0, which is the term where we have equal numbers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems more reasonable. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Wait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was right the first time, and the answer is 384. But I'm confused now. Let me check what the problem says again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem wants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think I need to clarify this. In most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product like this, it's referring to the term where the exponents match exactly, including any other variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), it might mean that \\(c\\) can be anything, so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because usually, you specify if you want a term independent of another variable. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all \\(c\\) terms, which would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't possible. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, let me go with that. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120.

Because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound quite right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\).

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6. Now, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the sum of coefficients is 64. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are convolutions of the coefficients of the original polynomials. But in this case, since one polynomial only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and the other only has \\(c\\) terms, they are completely separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a factor that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently.

So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let's solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) part at all. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the other expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, maybe it's considering all possible terms, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. Wait, but that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is referring to the entire expression. Wait, no, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from -6 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible \\(c^m\\) term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit strange because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me assume that's the case. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term in the second part, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me check that again. The first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is also raised to the zero power. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Wait, but I might be missing something. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no. That can't be right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part doesn't depend on the other part unless the other part is also contributing to that term. But in this case, the other part is about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only looking for terms where the result has \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right either because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that doesn't sound right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. Let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with a smaller exponent to see if the logic holds. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, we had exponents 1 and 1. So, \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The term \\(a c\\) is \\(a^1c^1\\), \\(a/c\\) is \\(a^1c^{-1}\\), and similarly for the others. So, there is no \\(a^1b^0\\) term; actually, each term has either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) but not both. Wait, so in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be zero because there's no term that has \\(a\\) without \\(b\\). Hmm, so my previous logic might be flawed. So, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is zero, not 2. Therefore, my initial approach is incorrect. So, what's the mistake here? I think the mistake is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply unless the other polynomial's terms don't interfere. But in reality, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second, and to get the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider all possible products that result in that term. But in the case where the variables are different, like \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) vs \\(c\\), the terms don't interfere. So, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficients of the terms in one part don't affect the coefficients of the terms in the other part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, in the smaller example, that didn't hold. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again. In the smaller example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, but when multiplied, the term \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(a c\\) and \\(a / c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is actually 2, but in reality, when you look for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's the sum of the coefficients from each term that results in \\(a\\). But since \\(a\\) is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is indeed 2. Wait, but when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(a c + a / c + b c + b / c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't a constant; it's a term involving \\(c\\). But in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the term \\(1\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's do that. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. To double-check, let me think about the entire expansion. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\((\\text{term from } (a + b)^4) \\times (\\text{term from } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by each term in the second part, which is in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part will contribute a term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the multiplication of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate. Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m\\) or something like that. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me try to think of it another way. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the expansion in \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^6\\), that would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), and similarly, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^4\\) would be \\(90a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, in the entire product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that's 6 times the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check this with a smaller example to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 0 because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term isn't present because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient is 0. But according to my previous approach, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) and 1 (from \\(b^2\\)), but actually, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\). Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient is 0, which matches the actual expansion. So, in this case, my approach of multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients in the second part would have given me 1 times 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my approach was wrong. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the second part is multiplied by the entire term, but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined only by the first part. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer should be 6. But wait, in the smaller example, the coefficient was 0, which is correct, so in the original problem, the coefficient is 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Therefore, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. So, I think the correct answer is 6. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was based on a misunderstanding. Now, after checking with a smaller example, I see that the coefficient remains as in the first part because the second part doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponent on \\(c\\), that's \\(c^{6 - m - m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, from the first part, we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not right because each term in the product is multiplied by the corresponding term in the other expansion.

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant.

So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.

So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply that by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me compute that.

Because if we take any other term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would mean the product would have \\(c\\) in it, but we only want the term without \\(c\\), so the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through it again. The first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the constant term. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we only care about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find how many ways we can get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   The total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the rest of the expression, which involves \\(c\\), is being multiplied, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from the other part is just 1, right? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. But wait, no, actually, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try to clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the \\(c\\) terms, you don't change the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient is 6, as I found earlier. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think of it differently. Suppose I expand both parts. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a sum of terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), \\(15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}^2\\), and so on, down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire product, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, I'll find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 multiplied by 20, which equals 120. Wait, so that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the coefficients multiply. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, but actually, no, because in the product, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. When you multiply two polynomials, the exponents add. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(k = 0\\). So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 times whatever the sum is from the other part. Wait, no, actually, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Since the other part is multiplied by the entire \\((a + b)^4\\), but we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and the rest is multiplied by that. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6? But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion could have multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply that by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can again use the binomial theorem. Let's write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
