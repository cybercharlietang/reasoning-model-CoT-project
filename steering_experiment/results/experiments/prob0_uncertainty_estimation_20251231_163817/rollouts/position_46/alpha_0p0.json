    "text": " Let me think. Suppose I took a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's not \\(a^2b^2\\), say \\(a^3b\\), and then multiplied it by a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^{-1}\\), then the product would be \\(a^3b \\times c^{-1}\\), which is \\(a^3b/c\\), which doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We needed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two binomials. We found the coefficient in each binomial separately, considering only the terms that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together, which required the second binomial to contribute a constant term.
