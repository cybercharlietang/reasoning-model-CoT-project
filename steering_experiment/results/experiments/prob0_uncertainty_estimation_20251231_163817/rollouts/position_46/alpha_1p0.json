    "text": " Let me think. Since the other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component. So, unless we're combining terms in a way that the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution would be from the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, expanding each part separately: - \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). - \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. However, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\), resulting in \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, that's the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 120. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 120. Wait, is there a possibility that other terms could combine to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, if I had a term with \\(c\\) and another term with \\(1/c\\), their product would be a constant. But in this case, since we're only considering the product of a single term from each expansion, unless the second expansion's term is a constant, any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, I think 120 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first sum, and then the term in the second sum must be \\(c^0\\), which corresponds to \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the constant term from the second polynomial. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Wait, let me check again. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15(1/c^2) + 6(1/c^4) + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply the 20 from the second expansion, giving \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the relevant coefficients from each binomial expansion.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
