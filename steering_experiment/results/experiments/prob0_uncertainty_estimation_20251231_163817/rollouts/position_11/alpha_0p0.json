    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to consider the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only affect the coefficients of the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, actually, the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) could contribute to the coefficients of the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then I need to find all the ways that when multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and each of those would contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), unless the second term is 1, which it isn't. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the product term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), but that can't happen because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since the product includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient as the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is given as part of the expression. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the problem. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might be it. Let me think. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients, and then you sum them all up. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But let me check that logic again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, it will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product. Hmm, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms with various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\), which isn't typically how coefficients are presented. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, how do I approach that? Let me break it down. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of the terms from each expansion that result in \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Well, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since the product of the two expansions is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's actually \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we're considering all coefficients from the second expansion, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the more likely interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Hmm, perhaps I should check both interpretations.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's probably referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\), and it's more common to ask for a specific term. So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and also, it's not considering the specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times 20, which is 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\), it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered as a term, then in the product, it would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times (1 + 1)^6, which is 6*64=384. But that seems high, and it's not considering the specific power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignores the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how the product works. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the products of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part. But that would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6*64=384. So, that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), their product is a polynomial where each term is a product of a term from P and a term from Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product would be the coefficient of that term in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*(sum of coefficients in Q). Therefore, the answer is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm now conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me try to see which interpretation makes more sense. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges such that the exponent from the second part is \\(6 - 2m\\), as we saw earlier. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from \\(k=2\\), and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has different exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2), giving 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, which would come from both \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a/c\\) is 1. So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be 2, but if it had asked for the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it would be 0 because there's no such term. Wait, that's not correct because \\(c^0\\) is 1, so \\(a c^0\\) is just \\(a\\), which in this case, the coefficient would be 0 because in the product, \\(a\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not by 1. Wait, that's confusing. So, in the product, the term \\(a\\) is only present if multiplied by \\(c^0\\), but in this case, there's no such term because the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) is 0. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any restriction on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. So, that would be 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct answer is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was 2, but the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\) was 0. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Because if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with \\(c^0\\), it's 120. I'm getting conflicting interpretations.\n\nWait, let me try to think about the standard way such problems are phrased. Usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's referring to the specific term with the given exponents, regardless of other variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial introduces other variables. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Therefore, that would be 6*64=384.\n\nBut then, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given that it's a math problem, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficients in the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a more mathematical approach. Let me consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k=2\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nSo, that confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\), and the coefficient would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nBut since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have another binomial expression multiplied by this. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the other part involving \\(c\\) might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms from the second binomial expression will just multiply the coefficient we found. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(c\\) terms would not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient because when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is implying that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're introducing \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just asks for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion where the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let me approach it that way. So, first, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which we did as 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by 20, resulting in 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we need to sum over all \\(k\\), but that would give us 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not the sum. So, I think my initial approach was correct: we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which seems unlikely because the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are separate polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), but that's just speculation. But given the problem as stated, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 384\\), which seems too high. Alternatively, if we're considering the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\[\n6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\n\\]\n\nSo, in this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, is 120. So, that confirms my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that part only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might just contribute a constant factor because we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, let me check that. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the entire coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each term would be the product of 6 and the coefficient from the second expansion. So, if I want the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient when considering all variables? Because if it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. But if it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, then it's just 6 because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but since the second part is a separate variable, the coefficient remains 6. Hmm, that seems more plausible. Let me confirm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, if I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is some expansion in \\(c\\), then each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then in the entire product, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer should be 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's in terms of \\(c\\). But I think that's not the case because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of that \\(c^k\\) term. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, since the entire expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which means the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a separate polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it doesn't specify. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated earlier, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me try to confirm this. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) times Q(c) would be the coefficient of that term in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) * Q(c), it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times Q(c). But since Q(c) is a separate variable, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * Q(c). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b), which is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but as it stands, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think the answer is 6. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, but that would require knowing the specific power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified. Therefore, perhaps the answer is 6. \n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) in the second expansion, and so on. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the answer is 6. \n\nWait, but that seems too simplistic. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and I expand it, I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Then, I multiply each of those terms by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nLet me confirm this approach. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part of the product doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that's not right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you would get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the expansion of the second part isn't a single coefficient. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. \n\nThe original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found to be \\(6a^2b^2\\), and it will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a single factor. But actually, no, because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(6a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so in the product, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times that constant, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply by any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'd get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the coefficients don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. From the first part, it's 6, and from the second part, the constant term is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term, which is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then we're multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait a second, does that mean we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion? Or is it possible that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms that don't involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if we take any other term from the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, but the problem only asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which we found to be 6. So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, that's not correct. Let me compute it properly: \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. When we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Hmm, but wait, could there be any other terms in the second expansion that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would still give \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which wouldn't be present in the original \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms? So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Hmm, I think that's correct.

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a coefficient in the product, but the product includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\)? Wait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But actually, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just 6 times something, but rather, in the entire product, each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the corresponding term in the other expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term. Wait, the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term from the second expansion). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term from the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire second expansion is multiplied by that, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion is 6 times the corresponding coefficient. But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents of \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times 64 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to confirm my earlier conclusion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require finding the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the term where \\(c\\) is also at a specific power, but since it's not specified, I think the answer is 384. But to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n\nIf it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the first case, 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6*20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered term-wise. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, so the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). This coefficient is then multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the first part, 6, is the final answer? Or do I need to consider the second part as well? Hmm, I think I need to consider both parts because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, then I need to multiply it by whatever term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because otherwise, the product would have terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just check if I did that correctly. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, the second part's constant term is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's the answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, that's correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, that's also correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. I don't see any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's just 1, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so we're looking for the constant term in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would mean we need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by that constant term, it won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if I thought that the entire expression's expansion would have cross terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the other expansion. So, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I don't need to consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we're looking for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Or maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning we're just looking for how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a sum over all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a bit strange. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a single number. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion. So, let me proceed with that assumption. \n\nSo, first, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. Then, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me do that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part, but we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make much sense because the question is phrased as asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which is a function of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something similar, but that's just speculation. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again seems odd. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other terms. But that would be 6, which seems too simple, especially since the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that would require knowing the exponents of \\(c\\), which isn't specified. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion, which would be 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written correctly, and the answer is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be \\(6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). But that's a polynomial, and the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to look for similar problems. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expansions, you have to consider the cross terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which seems unlikely. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is phrased as asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \u00d7 6} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then that's it, because multiplying by the other expression doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these will be just \\(a^2b^2\\), because they'll all have some power of \\(c\\). Wait, so that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, you'll have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\), so there's no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), \\(c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 = c\\), and so on, down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). When I multiply these together, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, looking at the product, the only term that would have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would be the middle term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which was 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I thought earlier that maybe the coefficient was zero, but that was a mistake. I see now that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can indeed be multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I realized that in order to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, I needed to multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I had to consider all possible cross terms, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any term that includes \\(c\\), the only contributing term is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Now, but wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would give a term \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't what we want. But if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\), then we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

But that seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).

If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that part as well. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because in the second expansion, there is a term where \\(c^{6 - 2k} = c^0\\), which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting more because it's given the entire expression including \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6. When we multiply this by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be the case because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's a different variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because when \\(c = 1\\), all the \\(c\\) terms become 1, and you're just left with the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for the problem. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's expand the second part:\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion has terms with \\(c^{6}\\), \\(c^{4}\\), \\(c^{2}\\), \\(c^{0}\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}=1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}=15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}=6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}=1\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Hmm, so when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, but only if the terms are like terms. But in this case, the other expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) would just multiply the coefficient, but the variable part would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be the case. Maybe I need to clarify: when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", does it mean the coefficient when considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\), or just the coefficient when ignoring \\(c\\)? Hmm, I think it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit complicated because then the coefficient would be a sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the product, meaning the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). But that still seems unclear. Wait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\), but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of all those coefficients. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), then it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think that's more likely what the problem is asking because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the intended answer is 120. Yeah, I think that's it.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication will just affect the coefficient by adding the coefficients from both expansions. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in it, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't get multiplied by anything else because it's already a standalone term without \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of that term in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because every term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, if the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me verify that. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, which is indeed 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, but I don't need to expand it fully. The sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term. Let me check that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). For the term to be constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, now I'm confused because I have two different answers: 384 and 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. \n\nI think the mistake I made earlier was assuming that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, but actually, when considering the product, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, any term in the second polynomial that has a power of \\(c\\) would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term (where \\(k = 0\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, let's recast this. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nFrom earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I did before, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think about this again. \n\nThe confusion arises from whether the entire second polynomial is multiplied into the first, or if only specific terms contribute. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term without \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, my initial approach was wrong because I thought that all coefficients from the second polynomial contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that's not the case. Only the constant term contributes because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me double-check this. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present because the expansion is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0. But if I have \\((a + b)^3 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), then the expansion of \\((a + b)^3\\) includes a \\(3ab^2\\) term, but again, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\), the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) would be if \\(ab^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (from \\(c^0\\)), but \\(c + 1/c\\) doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term, so the coefficient would still be 0. Wait, but in our original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, so that's why we have a non-zero coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, let's take another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term here, so the coefficient is 0. \n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) is \\(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(2a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), \\(2ab c^2\\), etc. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but since the second polynomial doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term, it's not present. Wait, actually, the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, so \\(a^2b^2\\) can't be formed unless the second polynomial has a \\(b^2\\) term, which it doesn't. Therefore, the coefficient remains 0. \n\nWait, but in our original problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only has \\(c\\) terms, so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). None of these are \\(a^2b^2\\) itself because they all have some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually 0, because none of the terms in the product will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Earlier, I thought that the constant term in the second polynomial would allow \\(a^2b^2\\) to be present, but now I'm thinking that even the constant term would result in \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly the term we're looking for. So, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, in my previous example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the product didn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\) doesn't have a \\(b^2\\) term. But in our original problem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, only \\(c\\) terms. So, how can \\(a^2b^2\\) appear in the product? It can't, unless the second polynomial has \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which only has \\(c\\) terms, so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(m\\) is the exponent from the second polynomial. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would require that \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\), and the exponent \\(m = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, yes, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does exist in the product because when \\(m = 0\\), the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but in my earlier example with \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the second polynomial doesn't have a term with \\(b^2\\). But in our problem, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms, so how can \\(a^2b^2\\) appear? It can't, unless the second polynomial has \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but in our problem, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed present, with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct coefficient is 120. \n\nI think my confusion earlier was because I was considering whether the entire second polynomial's coefficients contribute, but actually, only the constant term contributes because it's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), allowing \\(a^2b^2\\) to remain as is in the product. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by something from the second part? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms from the first part will only involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms from the second part will only involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're only interested in the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (from the second part). Because if it's multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\), then the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term (i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\))?\n\nLet me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part gives a constant term 20. So, when we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being the product of two polynomials, so each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are such that they result in a constant term, then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check another way. Suppose I write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k=2\\), and the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That confirms it. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Hmm, I think it does because the entire term \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply by the other expression, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Maybe I don't need to multiply by the entire sum of coefficients because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when I multiply by the second expression, each term in the second expression will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to sum all the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that brings me back to 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when we multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply with each term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how it interacts with the second expression. However, the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so to get a term that's only \\(a^2b^2\\) without any other variables, the exponent of \\(c\\) in the second part must be zero, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, when m=3, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we have 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we have 20. So, multiplying them together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't overlook anything. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). The first part gives 6 for that term, and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6\u00d720=120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to pick the term from the second expansion that doesn't contribute any \\(c\\) terms, which is the constant term. So, that's why we needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that approach also makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and checked my work.

That is, when you expand the entire product, what's the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second.

Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify, so maybe I need to look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some constant, but that can't be because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the product of the coefficients. But that seems unclear. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.

So, to find that, I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and multiply their coefficients together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So, maybe I should go back to the initial assumption that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the product of the coefficients. So, 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense unless the problem is expecting a polynomial as the coefficient, which is unusual. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the product of the coefficients, so 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they interact. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^5(1/c) + 15c^4(1/c)^2 + 20c^3(1/c)^3 + 15c^2(1/c)^4 + 6c(1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\): \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. However, that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would mean the sum of all coefficients in the second part multiplied by 6, giving 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). That would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that seems unusual because typically, when asking for the coefficient of a term, you specify all variables involved. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), maybe it's expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignore the second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the product. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be expressed as a polynomial, but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that's a bit abstract. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Let me check that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems reasonable. So, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the more likely intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, that's just the first part. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that term can come up is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that's a constant (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), which isn't what we're looking for. So, the coefficient we're seeking is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we have terms with exponents \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Wait, but that's not exactly correct either, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the power of \\(c\\) should be zero, meaning \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me calculate that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively multiplying it by each term in that expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we have to consider all possible terms? No, wait, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that means we have to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the constant term in the second part. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.
