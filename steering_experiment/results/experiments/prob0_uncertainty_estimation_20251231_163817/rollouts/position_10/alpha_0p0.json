    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that's 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what its expansion looks like. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term will be \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, but since the entire expression is the product of two expansions, I think I need to multiply the two expansions together. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, they are independent variables. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part is \\(6a^2b^2\\), as we found earlier. Then, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term from the second expansion)}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds up all those coefficients. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in this case, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all its coefficients, which is 64, so 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, that would give 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms just become separate terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me double-check my reasoning. The first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, when expanded, has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). When I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\)? Or does the entire expression multiply, so I need to consider how the coefficients might combine? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, I think it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Let me correct that. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^4\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(6a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the \\(a^3b\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(6a^3bc^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for just \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 times 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term we're looking for. So, yes, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this part affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's like I'm multiplying by some polynomial in \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just 6 times whatever factor comes from the second part? Wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to find all the terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\) and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor and the second factor is only in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe I should treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, and thus the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part is separate. But that seems too simple. Let me try another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see how they multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients from the binomial expansion. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded similarly. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a product, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify: When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in the product are all combinations of terms from each expression. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression would be multiplied by every term in the second expression, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but without specifying a particular power, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which is not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but in that case, it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) term, but without specifying a particular \\(c\\) term, it's not possible to give a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see if it affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients shouldn't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum of terms, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is a bit of a trick question, and the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think again: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part. But that's not a single coefficient. Therefore, I'm starting to think that maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction because it's multiplied by 1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is definitely part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and recognizing that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, sums to 64 when all coefficients are considered, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms will come from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't contribute to the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial. Wait, but the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only considering the part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part doesn't have a constant term; it's all in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, from earlier, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I just found. Wait, but actually, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other terms? Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), right?

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, when they say \"coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they mean the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term from the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients becomes a coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me verify this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is being multiplied, it's like distributing that 6 across all terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every possible term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a specific term, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, is that correct? Or is it more nuanced?\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those terms will have some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a, b, c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but I don't think so. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that would give a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpret the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expressions together, you get a product that includes terms with various powers of \\(a, b, c\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we have to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), and then sum up all those coefficients because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nLet me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, we also need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0 because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, by breaking it down, we find that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first binomial, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(m = 3\\) in the second binomial. So, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), because each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in the second part that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term without \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, as calculated before. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). That's \\(6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6 \\times 6) = 720/36 = 20\\). Yep, that's correct. And \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think my initial assumption was wrong, and the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nJust to confirm, let me think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, so 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where this exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that I just need to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire second part? Or is there something else I need to consider? Hmm, actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to see if any of the terms from the second expression affect that term. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part, right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine in a specific way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The expression is a product of two separate expressions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms in the first expression don't interact with the terms in the second expression in terms of exponents. So, when you multiply them, the exponents just add up for each variable separately. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term in the second expression has its own coefficient and variables. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply them, the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expression, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and then sum their coefficients. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. But that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me rephrase the problem: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That seems more reasonable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let's confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I had considered that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, it's more logical that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Let me summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but not specifying any particular power. Then, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient accordingly, but since it's not specified, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384. But that seems too high, and also, the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum of coefficients. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I think that's the right approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), I think that the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the second part contributes a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in other words, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about how that works. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check that again. Actually, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 20. Now, going back to the original expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. When we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Because when I multiply the two expansions, every term from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider only the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20, but wait, no. Wait, that's not right. Because the entire expansion is the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms}\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). The other terms in the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, I think that's correct. Let me just verify the calculations again. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.

So, I think I need to consider both expansions because the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) is just 1, and multiplying by 1 doesn't change the term.

Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just be multiplied by the constants from the second expression. \n\nWait, actually, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because in the entire product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. Hmm, that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then from the second part, say, I have a term like \\(c^3\\), then the combined term would be \\(6a^2b^2c^3\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, because regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. But that seems too simple, and perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut let me check this again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, when you multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion. Each term in the product is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that's fixed. Now, for each such term, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier result.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and see.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\): as I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients is indeed 64 when \\(c = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I've got it now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single value; it's a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those terms. Wait, no, that can't be because the problem is probably treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me check that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the middle term, because the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), and the middle term is when the exponent is 0. Alternatively, I can use the binomial theorem for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me write that out. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms and sum them up. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the entire term is just a number. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my reasoning. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1 = 6, \\(a^2b^2c^5\\) would have 6 * 6 = 36, and so on, until \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\) with coefficients 6, 36, 120, etc. But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's more likely that they want the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the \\(c\\) terms entirely, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, probably, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by another approach. Alternatively, I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would result in a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve all the terms from the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term. \n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiply them together to get 6 * 20 = 120.

Maybe the problem is expecting me to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then state the coefficient, but that doesn't seem to make sense because the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical, not expressions. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But that would mean the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the terms from the second expansion. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. In this case, since \\((a + b)^4\\) contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is another polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute this and express it as such.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial. But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. Let me check that interpretation. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6. That sounds plausible. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Maybe the problem is indeed expecting the coefficient to be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because coefficients are typically numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient in the product without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go back. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times each of these terms, meaning the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be this entire expression. However, that seems too involved, and I suspect the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps assuming that \\(c\\) is being treated as a constant or that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just expecting the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the second factor is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, without considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you expand the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the problem's phrasing, which is asking for \"the coefficient,\" implying a single numerical value. Therefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the expansion, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the entire product. Let me approach it differently. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) would have terms where each term from \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each term from \\(Q\\), meaning the coefficient is 6 times \\(Q\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product without considering \\(c\\), which would be impossible because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and find the coefficient accordingly. But that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting the entire polynomial as the coefficient. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems inconsistent with standard terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem from another angle. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the corresponding terms. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term from the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\).\n\nBut that seems too involved, and I suspect the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the expansion, but that seems inconsistent with standard terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, resulting in a polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. So, the answer would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nBut that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the expansion, but that seems inconsistent with standard terminology.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is just part of the expression, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simplistic because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would involve the second part.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, so 120. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider any terms that involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the term. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nSo, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) because we don't want any \\(c\\) terms in the final product. Because if we have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), but if we have \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), that would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want. So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since the two expansions are multiplied together, and we're only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) sum to zero. So, that's exactly what we did. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. 6 times 20 is 120, correct. So, yeah, I think that's right. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, we can treat the two parts separately and then multiply their coefficients because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms in the product. So, yeah, I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just contribute a scalar. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply two terms, one from each binomial, the exponents add up. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and is 20. When we multiply these two terms together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms from the second part would introduce some power of \\(c\\), which would make the overall term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which we're not interested in. So, only the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), yes, that's 6. For \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two independent expressions multiplied together, the coefficients multiply for the terms that don't interfere with each other. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expression and \\(c^0\\) is from the second, and they don't involve overlapping variables, their coefficients just multiply. So, that's another way to see that it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering all the terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just the term without any \\(c\\) terms, right? So, actually, I need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\) because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part that result in \\(c^0\\). So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the second part is. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would expand to a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, because only the constant term would multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's purely \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that logic again. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, which is 6, and then multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expansion. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum over all terms in the second expansion, but since only the constant term contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to multiply the entire expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term would result in a term without \\(c\\), so yes, 6*20=120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms combine. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and to get a term without \\(c\\), we have to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6*20=120.

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, it's just adding more terms with different variables.

Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the part that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating the entire product as a single expression, and they're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), giving terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is only the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning it's 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a single coefficient but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that is, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but I need to confirm if this is correct. Let me think again: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that the entire product includes all possible powers of \\(c\\), I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would indeed be 120.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the other factors involving \\(c\\) will just be constants multiplied by the coefficient. But wait, actually, no, because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part at all, because it's a separate variable. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other terms involving \\(c\\) will just be coefficients multiplied by that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) raised to various powers, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those will contribute a term to the final product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in other words, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first polynomial, right? So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will be a term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each time you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial, you get a new term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term in the product. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would give \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself isn't present unless the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because only when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial will you get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, so the coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. So, that makes sense now. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that's not correct either because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific term, not the sum of all coefficients. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a monomial involving \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in multiple terms of the product, each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) term. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But let me check: the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct? Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, that seems a bit too straightforward. Let me verify with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, that seems to confirm that the method works. Therefore, applying it to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over all powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because in the smaller example, it worked when I considered the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) as 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, perhaps that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me check that possibility. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. So, which one is it? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, in the smaller example I did earlier, when I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was 2, which is 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, that seems to confirm that when you don't specify the power of \\(c\\), you're summing over all possible coefficients. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But without more context, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384.\n\nSecond, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\) at all, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me compute the product step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
