    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is straightforward; the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem correct either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, meaning it can have negative exponents as well. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we just need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so perhaps the entire expression is being treated as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly accurate. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient and a specific power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has a specific coefficient and a specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each coefficient in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? The way the problem is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's the former: regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply that by 6. But since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that we're summing over all coefficients, so 384 is the answer. Let me double-check my reasoning. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will expand to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their own coefficients. When you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, \\ldots, a^2b^2/c^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, effectively, we're summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by the coefficient from the first expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384 is the correct coefficient. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all 2, 2, and 0 respectively, then we would have needed to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply that by 6. In that case, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), since we need the term where \\(k = 3\\) to get \\(c^{6 - 2*3} = c^0\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, 6 * 20 = 120 would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384. Let me just verify this with another approach. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to consider the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, but since the expression is multiplied by another binomial expansion, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion, you want the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) to cancel out so that the entire term becomes a constant, right? Because if I'm looking for just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then the other part should not contribute any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent is zero. Let me think about how that works. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need this exponent to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), and that's 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6, correct. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20, correct. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), and also by other terms, but those other terms would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the exponent of \\(c\\) non-zero. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is zero, right? So, that means the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in each term sum to 2, but wait, no, because the first part is only contributing \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is contributing a term with \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient is just 6 times 20, as I thought before. \n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, since those are the only terms that will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together. So, that gives 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part times whatever comes from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the coefficient remains the same. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Because if I take any other term from the second expansion, which has powers of \\(c\\), then the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving me \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) times \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply them together, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that makes sense. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that the second expansion only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the overall coefficient is just the product of the two coefficients. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the overall coefficient. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. Wait, actually, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but actually, no, that's not right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 (which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my reasoning again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, correct. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe I should consider that each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if that's the case, then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Wait, that's the same as \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so we have \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, when this is multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because that's the sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\). So, that brings us back to 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term are \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\). Therefore, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, the coefficients don't just multiply like that. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). But in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't just 2. Wait, so in that case, my earlier approach would be incorrect because the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't just 1 times the sum of the coefficients, but rather, it's the sum of the coefficients multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, so maybe I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Because if it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. But if it's the latter, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be different. \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's indeed 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's different. \n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the entire expansion. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum over \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure. Let me think of it another way. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by 64, it becomes 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm it. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so the total is 384. \n\nWait, but in the original problem, are we supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? I think so, yes. So, that would mean that each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I've gone through this multiple ways and each time it comes out to 384, so I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

So, I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part of the product, right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that seems correct because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Because when you multiply two expressions together, sometimes cross terms can affect the coefficients. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(0\\), \\(-c^2\\), \\(-c^4\\), \\(-c^6\\) (I think), but all of these involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, none of these cross terms would affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the resulting terms would be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. So, in other words, the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe I do need to consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. Let me try that. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 6, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from the first part, but it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is only present when it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the term \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the \\(c\\) terms wouldn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but now I'm seeing that actually, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that must be the correct answer. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of these two coefficients, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I was initially confused because I thought maybe the \\(c\\) terms wouldn't affect it, but actually, since we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we have to consider that part as well. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so does that mean that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient just gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there something else I need to consider? Hmm, maybe not. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion. But actually, no, wait. When I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant. Any other term involving \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would result in a term that's not just \\(a^2b^2\\), but something else involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) and the constant term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is another binomial expression. Let me think about how this interacts with the first part. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But wait, the first expansion only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. That means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part won't affect the variables in the second part.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider that term in the first expansion, which is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion and sum up the coefficients? Or is there a specific term we need to consider?\n\nWait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in other words, the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion will multiply with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense. So, let me try that approach. \n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, I'll get 6 times that constant term times \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have had to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume they want the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term, so that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me check my reasoning again. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. The first part contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), can contribute any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that they're considering the entire product, and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think my answer is correct: 120. \n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

But the way the problem is phrased, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the other expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a product, but treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the coefficient would be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering all terms in the product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that we need to sum over all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). But that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But is that the case? Wait, no, because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I would get 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, let's try that approach. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can consider the product as the product of two separate expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with \\(k = 2\\), as we found earlier, giving a coefficient of 6. Now, the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the constant term. So, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. \n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), resulting in the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, when I multiply two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), the coefficients of the terms in \\(P(a, b)\\) will multiply the coefficients of all terms in \\(Q(c)\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term by itself, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(P(a, b)\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{-m}\\), etc., depending on the expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2 c^{-m}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), that would give you \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) constant, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be that constant. But wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), you're creating new terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\), but that's not correct because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in another. So, when you multiply these together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something. Alternatively, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which is not what is asked. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would give a coefficient that's a number, not involving \\(c\\). Wait, but let me think again: if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply these two together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which is a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2 c^0\\) in the product, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the final coefficient will be 6 multiplied by that value. So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems right. Let me double-check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire coefficient being the product of the two coefficients because the terms are independent. So, yeah, I think that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through it again. First, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach to verify. Suppose I think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which I think refers to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But 6 * 64 = 384, which is way larger than 120, so that approach must be wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that reasoning. So, going back, the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by it, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) explicitly to make sure the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20. Let's see: when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2*3} = 20 c^{0}\\), which is correct. So, yes, that's 20. Therefore, the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) again. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. That means the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\)? That is, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, so 6 times 64, which is indeed 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, it's like each term in the second part gets multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each \\(c\\) term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But wait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), I think it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake because the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any k. So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6. So, yes, I think 384 is correct. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's clarify. The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find that. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6*64=384. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present once, but in this case, it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have (a + b)^4*(c + 1/c)^6. If I expand it, I get terms like a^4b^0c^6, a^4b^0c^4, ..., a^0b^4c^6, etc. So, the term a^2b^2 would be multiplied by each c term. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, yes, 6*64=384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but I just thought of another way. Maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of c's power, so it's the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of a and b are 2, regardless of c. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I think of the entire expansion, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6, and then when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it's like 6*(c + 1/c)^6, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6*(sum of coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6). So, 6*64=384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply out the entire expression, the coefficients from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply together. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms; their coefficients will just multiply the existing coefficients from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I can just compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, so each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me try that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the term with \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. I think that's correct. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first part of the product, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they might be considering the product as a whole. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expression for the corresponding terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you expand the product, each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^2b^2c^k. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is the sum over all k of (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part for c^k). But since the coefficient from the first part is 6, it's 6 times the sum over all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe 384 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire expression, perhaps we need to consider the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied, the coefficient remains 6, but that doesn't seem right because the other part is also a polynomial. Wait, no, because when you multiply by another polynomial, the coefficients of the terms in the first polynomial are scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are to be ignored, or that the coefficient is considered as a polynomial. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that approach.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did earlier, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible exponents, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, so perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate polynomial, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied, so it scales the coefficients.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the answer the problem is expecting. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely because the problem would probably specify if they want the coefficient as a polynomial.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But in that case, the answer would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, let me go with that interpretation. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Then, multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut let me confirm: if I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, I think that's the answer the problem is expecting.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\), the term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\), with coefficient \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems like the coefficient is 384 times \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. But that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) differently depending on the exponent of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term, you're considering specific exponents for all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is a polynomial, but if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, like zero, then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely certain.\n\nWait, let me think again: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be paired with any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, then perhaps they're considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients of the second polynomial) = 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6*(c + 1/c)^6, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the problem is in the context of a generating function, where we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64=384. But I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can look at a simpler example to clarify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, expanding, it's \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if it asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2c^0\\), it would be 1. So, in this example, depending on the interpretation, the coefficient can be a polynomial or a number.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's a polynomial, but if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's a number. Since the problem didn't specify, but just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the polynomial, but that seems unlikely because usually, when a coefficient is asked without specifying other variables, it's considered as a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Since the problem is presented as a math problem expecting a numerical answer, I think it's more likely that they're expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute the entire coefficient as a polynomial and see if that makes sense. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But if the problem is expecting a numerical answer, then perhaps it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\). I wonder if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficients from each part multiply together when you multiply the two expressions. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the other part involves \\(c\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). If there's such a term, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from both expansions. If not, then the coefficient would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have some power of \\(c\\) attached, which we don't want.\n\nSo, let me check if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term. To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 as the constant term. When I multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. However, only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term without \\(c\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term), giving 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me think again. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20. When I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. But only the 20 will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficients from the second part will just multiply the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but no, because the second part is separate; it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Because if I have \\(a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + ... + \\dfrac{1}{c^6})\\), then each term in the second part will contribute a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But actually, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be any integer from, say, -6 to 6. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients of the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. The entire expression is the product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiplier for the first part's coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, which is the same as in the first expansion, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion could contribute to the coefficients, but since it's multiplied by each term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a,b)*Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), but since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from P(a,b) times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and 1, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Wait, no, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean that the coefficient would actually be the sum of the products of the coefficient from the first part and each term from the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term in the second expansion, it would be multiplied by something involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right either because the second expansion has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the terms interact. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get the product of two expansions. Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms with different exponents of \\(c\\), and each would contribute to different terms in the product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just verify that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since we're looking for the term where both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\) are present, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by the constant term from the second, which is 20, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we only care about the terms where, after expansion, the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in other words, the \\(c\\) terms in the second part shouldn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that the \\(c\\) terms will contribute a coefficient as well, but since they're separate variables, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then any term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{-(6 - m)}\\) or something? Wait, no, actually, each term in the first expansion is \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in the second expansion is \\(c^m \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - m} = c^{2m - 6}\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way a term will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by every possible term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part? But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second, leading to cross terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-(6 - m)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that implies that we are considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we are to find the coefficient of the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would have any power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is considered as a polynomial, but only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, that might be it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is from 0 to 6. But we are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(k = 2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the coefficient for each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(2m - 6\\). But since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a coefficient. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right because the second part is a sum of terms, so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the entire other polynomial would indeed involve multiplying by each term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider a simpler case to verify. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. So, that seems to check out. Similarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding, \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2c\\) is 1, of \\(a^2(1/c)\\) is 1, so total coefficient for \\(a^2\\) terms is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, some terms could combine in a way that affects the coefficient? For example, if the second part had a term that would cancel out, but in this case, since we're just multiplying, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, and since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, leading to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression is \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the number of ways to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), then the first part becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 = 16\\), and the second part is 64, so the total is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is just part of the product. But since we're considering all possible terms in the second part, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in this part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"
