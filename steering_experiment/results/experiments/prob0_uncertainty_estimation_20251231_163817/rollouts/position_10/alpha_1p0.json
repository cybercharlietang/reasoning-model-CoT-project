    "text": " Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for \\(k=2\\). The binomial coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if I need to expand this as well, but I think since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect that term. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the second part just contributes a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, we need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(c\\) won't appear in the term. So, the term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be the constant term, which is the middle term when expanding. Let me find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, right? Because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. And in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other variables are \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we want the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power, so that when we multiply, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found is just from the first part. But when I multiply this by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), or perhaps by any term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is just \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify. Suppose I have two polynomials, P and Q. If P has a term \\(x\\) and Q has a term \\(y\\), then when you multiply P and Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if P has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and Q has, say, \\(c^6\\), then the product will have a term \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term in Q will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me try to think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by any term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only affected by the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder how this part affects the coefficient we found earlier. Wait, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, then when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a factor that's multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c=1\\), so substituting \\(c=1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Wait, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that seems like it's the case. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that seems too simple, given that the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, making it 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, it's (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but that's not the case here. Wait, no, actually, in the expansion, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, in \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the terms are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\). Similarly, the \\(2ab\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(2abc\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, in the original problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m / c^n\\) where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that seems too simplistic. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified, so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\), each with their own coefficients. So, the product would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the earlier example, when I set \\(c=1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients as 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems like it's not the case. I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is just multiplied by that, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two expressions, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * Q(c), but that doesn't make sense because Q(c) is a polynomial in c, not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of c, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is irrelevant because the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire expression. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that. But as it stands, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c=1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6*64=384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same. In this case, the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the product, each term is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate terms, so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\), then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, in the product, we'll have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present if there's a term in \\(B\\) that is \\(1\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). Because only then would the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. So, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. Therefore, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Because if I'm multiplying the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). But the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), we get \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me think again. The first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply them, you get \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean the coefficient from the second part is 1? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) cancel each other out, but actually, since we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms in the final expression, perhaps all we need is the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of both expansions. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the overall coefficient. Wait, but actually, no. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient from the first part because the second part is multiplied by 1 (since we're considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out). Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. So, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6\\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, \\(6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product will be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, adds to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to calculate 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that should be correct. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient to the product, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.

The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me compute the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect that term because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the presence of \\(c\\) terms doesn't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems off because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by any term in the second part, which is in \\(c\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? But that doesn't make much sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all possible terms from the second polynomial multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that might be it. Let me think again. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), which is \\(c^4\\), and so on down to \\(c^0\\) or \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has multiple terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some coefficient)} \\times c^{\\text{some exponent}}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to collect all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, which would be all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second polynomial has its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. But actually, in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of which is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you distribute, each term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^k\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient, but since \\(c^k\\) is separate, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. Therefore, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the constant term, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require the second polynomial to contribute a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Let me explore that possibility. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384 as above. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by 6. Let me compute that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm confused now. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes problems assume that you're looking for the coefficient of a term that includes all variables, but in this case, it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Then, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Then, it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But to be thorough, let me see if the problem could be interpreted another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * (sum of coefficients of second polynomial) = 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), then it would be 120, but since it's not specified, it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second polynomial. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by each term of the second polynomial, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of these contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had been \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\), then it would be different, but in this case, the variables are separate. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be absolutely sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\). First, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. The second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1. The sum of coefficients is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's verify by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The terms involving \\(ab\\) are \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\). The coefficients are 2c and 2/c. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, which matches our earlier calculation. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 (from the first polynomial) multiplied by 2 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). Therefore, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me compute that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. Therefore, when I multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that means I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, since the entire expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum up the coefficients from those terms. But wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first expansion, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are determined by the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when I multiply it by the entire second expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges accordingly from the second expansion. But wait, no, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(c^t\\) or \\(c^{-t}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^t\\) and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-t}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, which have different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but each term has a coefficient. However, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), the second expansion becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a sum over multiple terms. So, let me clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be the case if we're considering the entire expression and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 in the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I should approach it that way. So, first, find the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's usually considering the term where the variables match exactly. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I think it's safe to assume it's \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient in front of it, considering all possible terms from the second part. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just \\(6\\) times the entire second expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion, but that would make it a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of the second part.

Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That seems plausible. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming they mean \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me confirm this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - We seek the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).\n   - The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6-2k}\\).\n   - Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so it's likely that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me try to think about it differently. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product expanded, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a separate expression, so the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified, so maybe it's just 6.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the entire product expanded, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that would be the coefficient.\n\nBut let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms, each being 6 times the coefficient of a specific term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's asking for the sum of all the coefficients, which would be 6 times 64, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple, and the problem includes both parts, so it's likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, making it 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, so it's 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient.\n\nBut let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're considering the coefficient as a number, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit of a stretch. Let me try to think of it another way. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, so maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that would correspond to the constant term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but not considering the \\(c\\) terms, then we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. So, let's find that.\n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but considering only the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. The problem says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the most plausible interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's possible that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) is raised to some power, but the problem doesn't specify, so it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be a polynomial. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, the only way to make sense of it is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, then it's likely that it's intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a number, but that interpretation might not be correct because the sum of coefficients is obtained by setting all variables to 1, which might not be the intended approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, I think that's the correct approach. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we're essentially looking for the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which gives us the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and the problem is likely asking for the coefficient when multiplied by the constant term, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me clarify. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is 384, which is a number, but that might not be the intended interpretation because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all terms \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reconcile this is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because the coefficient is a number.

If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term.

    "text": " Let me compute the coefficient for that term. The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because those will affect the terms in a different way. Wait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the constant term? Because if I multiply 6 by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is what I want. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that each occurrence of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would affect the \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms from both expansions. But in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be interpreted differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out to give \\(c^0\\). So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0, which implies k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought it might be 120 if we were considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Now I'm confused because the problem isn't clear on whether it wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on all powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just about the product, and when it asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the \\(c\\) terms must cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me try to clarify. If I consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times 64 = 384. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20 = 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think it's the former, i.e., 384. But wait, that seems too large, and perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 for \\(ac\\) and 1 for \\(a/c\\), so total coefficient is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2 as well. So, in this smaller case, the approach works. Therefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression should be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait a minute, but earlier I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Now I'm confused because my small example seems to support the 384 answer, but perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think again. In the small example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is correct because \\(a\\) appears in both \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2. Similarly, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer should be 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check another angle. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms specified, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20 = 120, as we calculated earlier. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each of these terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients as 2, and when I multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\\), which is 1, I got 2, which matched the expansion. So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the product step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expanded would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 (since the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 1), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 (since the coefficient of \\(c^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 6 * 15 (since the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 (as we saw earlier), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) would be 6 * 15, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) would be 6 * 6, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) would be 6 * 1. So, if I sum all these coefficients, it would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, that confirms that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, this coefficient is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute some constants or terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is? Wait, no. Wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second part that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you would end up with a term that has \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in the second part. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that part. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear? For example, if I had terms from the first expansion and terms from the second expansion that combine in such a way that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but I don't think so because the second expansion only has \\(c\\) terms, which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion with the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct. So, multiplying these coefficients, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

So, I think I need to consider that as well. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Or do I have to consider them? Hmm, let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply two expressions, the terms from each are multiplied together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, so the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each multiplication. But that seems complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But wait, let me check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two variables multiplied together, like \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k (1/c)^m\\), the variables are independent, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would cancel out) in the second part is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you have \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when you have three \\(c\\) terms and three \\(1/c\\) terms, so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, but that's not correct because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be affected by the terms in the second expansion that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is all terms, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers, 120 and 384, depending on how I approach it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is c + 1/c, and similarly for \\(b\\). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire expression, it's (c + 1/c). Similarly, for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the multiplication by the second part, which only involves \\(c\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't affect the \\(c\\) exponent. Wait, that makes sense because if you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), which is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k - m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that would make it 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and the \\(c\\) terms don't matter, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But the problem states: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems counterintuitive because the problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, as the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients combine.\n\nWait, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part (which is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, that seems consistent. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a constant, which might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all terms, meaning the sum of the coefficients when \\(c = 1\\), which would be 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because in the simpler example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Which is correct?\n\nLet me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents along with \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems unlikely because the problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider only the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me check this with a concrete example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term has only one \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) from the first expansion multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) from the second. Wait, no, in this case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so when multiplied by \\(c + 1/c\\), each term is multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2\\) becomes \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), the term \\(2ab\\) becomes \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), and the term \\(b^2\\) becomes \\(b^2c\\) and \\(b^2/c\\). So, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), and when multiplied by the second expansion, which is degree 1 in \\(c\\), you don't get a term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both squared and multiplied together. Wait, but in the original problem, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, when you multiply by the second expansion, each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But in my smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no such term. Wait, but in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in my smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that doesn't make sense because the product includes all possible combinations with \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignoring the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, does that mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 384? Or are we looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120?\n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure because sometimes when variables are involved, people might consider only the term where the other variables cancel out. But in this case, since the problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other variable is \\(c\\), perhaps it's acceptable to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, let me check online. Wait, I can't actually check online, but I can think about similar problems. For example, if you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, maybe I should consider both possibilities. \n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me try another approach. Let me compute the product step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which can be expanded using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6 = c^6\\)\n- \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of the second part is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the first expansion by the second expansion, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in:\n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from all these terms. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which includes all possible \\(c\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me confirm this by considering the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384, which matches the manual calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, giving 120. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 384.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking and checking, I conclude that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of each part and then combining the results. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Next, recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me calculate the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think: When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients are independent. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those products will contribute to terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the contributions. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would result in terms that have \\(c\\) raised to different powers, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself would be multiplied by each of those, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Let's denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). When expanding \\(A \\times B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in this case, the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(B\\), which is 20. Because if you multiply by any other term in \\(B\\), you'll get \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but the problem is only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the entire product. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product when \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the only term in the product that would have exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the constant term from the second part. So, that would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which matches what I had before. So, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Alternatively, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). But that's not the same as the constant term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, but that's not correct because the variables are separate. Wait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me clarify: When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. But in this case, the variables are separate. So, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the part where \\(k = 2\\) in the first polynomial, and any term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute that binomial coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply out the entire expression, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it only introduces terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the entire second part is. Wait, but actually, the second part is being raised to the 6th power, so it's a separate expansion. But since we're only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire second part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, when you multiply by \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), you'd get terms with \\(c\\) involved. So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). That makes sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let's tackle the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in the second part. So, that constant term is indeed 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. I think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me calculate that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, that part is straightforward. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only present in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just a scalar multiple. Therefore, maybe the coefficient remains the same? But wait, that doesn't sound right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I think I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will contribute a scalar factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I have the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) or anything else. Wait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power? Because in the expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit off because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be an expression in terms of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all the terms from the second part that result in \\(c^0\\). So, let me think. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives me \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) can be positive or negative. To get a term with \\(c^0\\), I need the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent to be zero, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term in the second part that contributes to \\(c^0\\) is \\(20\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by \\(20\\) from the second part, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives a constant term of \\(20\\), so multiplying them gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is indeed \\(120\\). Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we need to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, I think that's correct.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are even numbers from -6 to +6, but the constant term would be when the exponent is 0. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To find the constant term, set the exponent equal to 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying it by the constant term of the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me double-check. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a scalar multiple, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the constant term would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, only the constant term contributes, and that's 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me compute that term. The coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both parts. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just a constant factor? Hmm, so if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is just a number, right? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms in the second part. But that can't be, because each term in the expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because each term in the expansion would have a coefficient, and I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion, which would result in multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is being multiplied by the first part, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that is multiplied by that term. So, in effect, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire sum of the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied in, so the coefficient should be scaled by the sum of the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the coefficient is just 6, because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Let's say I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(24a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (regardless of the power of \\(c\\)) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that's 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*(64) = 384. So, yes, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), the answer would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   When expanded, this part has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to account for the entire expansion's contribution. The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient I found. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficients from each part should multiply together when we take the product. So, if I have a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by terms from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can remain as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, now I need to find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The binomial coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, the first part gives me 6a^2b^2, and the second part when expanded gives me 20c^0, so when I multiply them, the term would be 6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, the coefficient for a^2b^2 comes only from the product of the a^2b^2 term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because any other terms in the second expansion would involve powers of c, which would make the term have c's, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of the c's. Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, so it doesn't matter what the c terms are. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.

Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But no, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But let me verify this with another approach. Let me consider expanding both parts separately and then see what happens when I multiply them. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the sum of these coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the entire second expansion, but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think it's 384. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part.

Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.
