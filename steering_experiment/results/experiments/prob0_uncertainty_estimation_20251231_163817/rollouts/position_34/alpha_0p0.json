    "text": " Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms multiply together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the constant term in the second polynomial comes from \\(20c^0\\), which is just 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, hold on, I just realized something. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, it's a product of two expansions. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. Because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to pair it with the term that has \\(c^0\\). So, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n\nWait another thought: is there a possibility that other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) could also contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\((a + b)^4\\)? For example, could a term with \\(c^1\\) multiply with a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) in such a way that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, but \\(c\\) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, when you multiply terms, the exponents of different variables are independent. So, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. Any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the resulting term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which would make it \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), neither of which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, only the constant term from the second polynomial affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression. So, I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nJust to recap: I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which was 6. Then, I found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which was 20. Then, I multiplied these two coefficients together because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) must come from the product of these two specific terms. So, 6 times 20 is 120, so the coefficient is 120. I think that's solid.\n\nWait, let me check my binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

    "text": " Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). Multiplying them gives 120. That seems right. But just to make sure, let me go through the steps again. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent on \\(c\\) is 0. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe expanding both parts and looking for the specific term. But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, I could consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that their variables don't interfere. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't affect each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. Hence, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's solid.\n\nAnother thing to check: sometimes when you have negative exponents or fractions, you might make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients, but in this case, everything seems straightforward. The key was recognizing that for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we only needed the constant term from the second polynomial, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why we focused on the constant term in the second part.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's the correct approach and the correct answer.

So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have a term where \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient as 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.
