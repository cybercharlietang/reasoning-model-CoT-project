So, I'm saying that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial (which is 6) by the constant term in the second polynomial (which is 20). That makes sense because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would add an exponent to \\(c\\), so the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two polynomials together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to pick the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(20c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. So, multiplying these together gives \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial with the term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. The coefficients for those terms are 6 and 20, respectively, so their product is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.

    "text": " Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, I considered that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is correct, and it's 6. Then, since we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way the resulting term doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is if we take the constant term from that expansion, which is when the exponent is 0. That makes sense because any other term would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part is indeed 20, so 6 * 20 is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like (polynomial in a and b) * (polynomial in c), the terms that result in the product have degrees in a, b, and c from each respective part. So, if you're looking for a term that only has a and b with specific exponents, you need to find the term in the first polynomial with those exponents and multiply it by the constant term (the term with c^0) in the second polynomial. That's exactly what I did. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if the method holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\). In \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is 0, which occurs when we take 1 term from c and 0 from 1/c, but wait, no. Wait, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\), so the only terms are \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\). There is no constant term here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 0 = 0, which makes sense because there's no constant term in the second polynomial. So, if I compute the entire product, \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)\\), expanding it would give me \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Indeed, there is no term with \\(a^1b^1\\), so the coefficient is 0. That checks out.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\). Let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\). In \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the constant term is when exponent is 0. Let's compute that: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2c*(1/c) + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the constant term is 2, with coefficient 2. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in the product is 3 * 2 = 6. Let's check by expanding the product: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). Multiply by \\(\\left(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\right)\\). The term \\(a^2b\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, \\(3a^2b * c^2 = 3a^2b c^2\\), \\(3a^2b * 2 = 6a^2b\\), and \\(3a^2b * 1/c^2 = 3a^2b / c^2\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b\\) is indeed present, with coefficient 6. So, that works too.\n\nTherefore, my method seems correct, so applying it to the original problem, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

    "text": " Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are multiplied together in the product expression, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
