But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, it's just the product of the two coefficients, 6 and 20, giving 120. So, I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct too. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. I don't think I missed anything here. The key was recognizing that when you multiply the two expressions, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
