    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, expanding it:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product, not just the first part.\n\nBut the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I just need to take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or do I need to consider specific terms from the second expansion?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Hmm, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire coefficient, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems odd because usually, when asked for the coefficient of a term, you consider the coefficient in the entire expansion. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would mean I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), since otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, I think that's the approach.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). \n\nHow do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm supposed to consider all the coefficients from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. Otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me check my math again. The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20, right? Because \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expansion, but that might be more complicated. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why I only need to consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I should sum all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6? That would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I was right the first time that it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), making the coefficient 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since \\(k\\) isn't specified, I think it's implied that \\(k=0\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I didn't consider the constant term, and instead just took the 6 and multiplied it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is involved, making it 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me see: if I just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the only way that makes sense is if they're asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a function of \\(c\\), which isn't a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems odd because coefficients are usually numbers. So, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it differently. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider this as a product of two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c\\) is set to 1, but that's not stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not worrying about \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion, making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, let me try to think of it as a single expression. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider it as 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting me to evaluate this at a certain value of \\(c\\), but that's not specified. So, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is 6, regardless of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression includes \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the problem is from a textbook or something, and maybe the answer is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the second part with \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not the case. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so I think it's only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion that contributes to the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's if I'm considering the coefficient when \\(c = 1\\), which isn't specified. So, I think that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the only way is to consider the constant term, which is 20, making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure my thoughts:\n\n1. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n2. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6.\n\n3. The other factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms involving various powers of \\(c\\).\n\n4. When multiplying, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n5. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc.\n\n6. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire product, would include all these terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and the product is a polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial.\n\n7. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when \\(c\\) is set to 1, which would make the second factor equal to 64, as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems different from my initial thought. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense as a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I think I need to be precise. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider the entire product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\\). But that's a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), giving 384. But that seems different from my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not what the problem is asking. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so I think it's referring to the coefficient when \\(c\\) is such that \\(c^0\\) is involved, making the coefficient 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to clarify:\n\n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\n- If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut the problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying anything about \\(c\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check my initial approach again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The other factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's considering the constant term, which is 20, making the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is useful. Maybe I should break it down into parts.\n\nFirst, let me consider the first part of the product: \\((a + b)^4\\). I know that using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of each term is given by the binomial coefficients, right?\n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can apply the binomial theorem here as well. That would give me \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Let me simplify that term. So, \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), which means each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait, but in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when the exponents add up to 4. Let me check: \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), so if \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNow, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's multiplied by the first part, I think we need to consider the entire product. But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, that means in the expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, it remains as a term without \\(c\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, perhaps the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just a standalone term, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as separate variables and \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve the product of the coefficients from both expansions, but only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the term a constant. So, the idea is that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I thought earlier, this is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), as \\(c^0 = 1\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the product of the two expansions is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the term where the product doesn't involve \\(c\\), i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second part is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product, so when we multiply out, each term is a product of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me compute the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me write out the expansions a bit more.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSo, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is:\n\n\\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20, which is correct.\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each part of the product separately and then see how they combine. The expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the \\(c\\) terms might not directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe I can handle each part separately and then multiply the results.\n\nLet me start with the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem, which states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\).\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So in the binomial expansion, this corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(y^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right?\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\cdot 2} = 6\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to think about how this part interacts with the first part. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to expand this part at all. Or wait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) terms, maybe the \\(c\\) terms can be anything, and they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. Wait, but when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the \\(c\\) part can be considered as a single coefficient that is multiplied by the 6 we found earlier.\n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be the same as the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't sound right. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have a different power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion because each term in the second expansion would contribute its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct either. Let me check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term just its coefficient. So if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384. So the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, each multiplication would just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the coefficient of the corresponding \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the answer is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. So I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only has terms involving \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would just add up all the coefficients, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts and see. But expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term from the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64. To find the sum of the coefficients in any polynomial, you substitute the variable with 1. So substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? So, in other words, in the entire expansion, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficient. So the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\".\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear with various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the sum over all such terms of their coefficients.\n\nBut in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. That makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, yes, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another approach: The problem could be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's just the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So that would be the same as 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that can't be right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient.\n\nWait, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that can combine to form that specific term when multiplied by terms in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only has terms in \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Another way to look at it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, and the first's coefficient is 6, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we would sum the coefficients, which are 1 and 1, giving 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). So 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, for \\(b\\), it's 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nSo applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first polynomial (6) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (64), giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the expansion is 64.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the sum of the coefficients from the second part (64):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Or perhaps the entire expression is multiplied together, so maybe I need to consider how the coefficients from both parts interact. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute some terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear there, maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part. Is that right? Or does the second part affect the coefficients somehow?\n\nLet me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I can get terms involving \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will give terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and so on. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the resulting term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't want.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply those two terms together, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. That makes sense.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficients we found from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The key idea is that since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, which is \\(c^0\\). Then, we multiply that coefficient with the coefficient from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part with any term from the second part that doesn't have \\(c\\). But since the second part only has terms with positive and negative powers of \\(c\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is when the exponents cancel out, which is when \\(c^6\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\) multiply together, but wait, no, that's not the case here. Wait, actually, each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), so when \\(m = 3\\), it's \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, yeah, that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that's why we take the coefficient 20 and multiply by 6.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I should break it down into parts because it looks like it involves expanding two binomials. \n\nFirst, let me focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem, which states that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n-k}y^k\\). So for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). \n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so that's correct. \n\nSo the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So that part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this part will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't matter here. Wait, but actually, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can consider that any term from the second expansion will just be a constant multiplier for the entire first expansion. So, if I take the term from the first expansion that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by the entire second expansion, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, no, that might not be correct because the second expansion isn't a single term but multiple terms.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by any term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion the same as evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\)? Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient, so the sum of the coefficients is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384?\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient, and since they all get multiplied by 6, the total would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the result is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) * a^2b^2 * c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term contributes 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think differently. Maybe I should consider that when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second polynomial as a constant because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that by another method. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\), the result is 6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when you distribute, each term becomes 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term contributes 6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} to the coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check if I'm considering the variables correctly. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients from both expansions. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the total is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here because the second expansion isn't a single term but multiple terms. Wait, but in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the second expansion isn't a single term, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like scaling the entire second expansion by 6, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\). In that case, since the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and since the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the first expansion is 2. The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's verify that by expanding:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nLooking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\), which is 2c and 2/c. So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, which matches 2 * 2 = 4. So, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the answer is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that might not be right. Let me check.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then when I multiply them, each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is in two variables, but I think the logic holds because the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so each term in the second expansion just scales the terms in the first expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion, which is 6, gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), it's separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, each term in the first expansion, like \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is something like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), just gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this logic holds. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from the first term), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 (from the third term). Now, according to my logic, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier logic. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, so in this smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, but according to my method, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect. Therefore, my initial approach must be wrong. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the smaller example, that approach didn't work. Hmm, maybe because in the smaller example, the second expansion is linear, so perhaps the approach works differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of generating functions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product contributes \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\), which is a separate variable, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a term with some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1, not 2. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's go back to the smaller example: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 (from \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\)), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 (from \\(bc\\) and \\(b/c\\)). So, if I were to compute the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's 1, but according to my method, it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion (which is 2), giving 2, which is incorrect. So, my method is flawed.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is different. Maybe I shouldn't multiply by the sum of coefficients. Instead, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because that's the only term that doesn't change the power of \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the problem statement, are we considering terms regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or are we looking for a specific power of \\(c\\) as well? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), so I think it's regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1, not 2. So, maybe the issue is that in the smaller example, the second expansion is of degree 1, so the sum of coefficients is 2, but in reality, when you multiply by \\(a\\), you get \\(2a\\), but in reality, the expansion is \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't a constant but a function of \\(c\\), so maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would also be a function of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, so perhaps I need to consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the smaller example, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a c^0\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion (which is 1) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is zero because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) has no constant term. So, the coefficient would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct because in the expansion \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), there is no constant term in \\(a\\). So, perhaps my initial confusion was because I was considering the sum of all coefficients, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but in reality, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would involve all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 1, not 2. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's likely that it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to compute it another way. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. If I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a function, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a function of \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which would imply that they are considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nHmm, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, so let me clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient became a function of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem expects 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as a single term. So, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because in the smaller example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps the correct answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is irrelevant because it doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes the second expansion.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But if we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because it gave an incorrect coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's the sum of all coefficients for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach didn't work because the coefficient of \\(a\\) was a function of \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps in that case, the problem is different because the second expansion's terms affect the coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as a generating function. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still confused because in the smaller example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and the second expansion is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both expansions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the term where \\(c\\) is also at its constant power, so \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), making the coefficient 384.\n\nBut in the smaller example, that approach didn't work. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 120.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify. Let me compute both possibilities:\n\n1. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\): 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n2. Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\): 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a constant, so 120.\n\nI think that's more likely. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a term \\(20c^0\\) (since when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is 0). So, when multiplied together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) times \\(20c^0\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nNow, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 6. So, the coefficient is 6. So, the term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion would be the product of two separate expansions. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can treat the two parts separately because when we multiply the expansions, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nWait, so if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But no, actually, that's not quite right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, regardless of what happens in the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't appear in the first, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not correct either because each term in the second polynomial has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not possible unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is the constant term, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6.\n\nOkay, so how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. So, the first part gives 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the second part's constant term is 20. So, when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1 (since c^0 is 1). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the terms are independent. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which is 20.\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by separately determining the coefficient in each part and then multiplying them. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (when \\(c^0\\)) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Maybe I can break it down into parts and use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, I remember that the binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this as:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can also expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\nSimplifying the exponents, that becomes:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nI notice that this part involves powers of \\(c\\), but since the original problem is asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I'm overcomplicating things here. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions, so I need to consider how the terms multiply together.\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, I need to find all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or is it? Wait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where the product includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the variables are different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all terms from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand both, we get a product of two sums. So, each term in the product is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're looking for all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and then we need to consider all terms from the second expansion multiplied by this 6. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would mean that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the variables are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. That might make more sense.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion when the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, in the product, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's approach it that way.\n\nSo, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). To get this, we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's find that.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is likely asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and in the second polynomial, I'm looking for the constant term, which is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c\\) terms, and just thought of the entire product as a single polynomial, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion affects the overall coefficient.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused myself earlier. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficients are attached to different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the product would be all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the coefficient is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these products, meaning 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That would make sense, and the answer would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which isn't a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4(c + 1)^6\\), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is usually a number, so I think the intended answer is 120, considering \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should break this down into parts. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). So, applying the binomial theorem, it would expand to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each.\n\nLet me write that out. If \\(a^{4 - k} b^k = a^2 b^2\\), then \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it involves \\(c\\), which isn't present in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, the overall coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Is there another way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) by combining terms from both expansions? For example, if I take a term with \\(c\\) from the second expansion and multiply it by a term without \\(c\\) from the first, but that would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which we don't want because we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if I made any calculation errors. So, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. Then, in the second expansion, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I missed any steps. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each.

Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\): that's \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (6) and the constant term from the second part (20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The entire expression is the product of two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that should give the correct coefficient.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n2. Find the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6.\n3. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n4. Find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), which is 20.\n5. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which occurs when \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the constant term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplying the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you expand expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nIn this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. So, for each term, the coefficient will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\) where \\(k\\) is the power of \\(b\\). The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nI'm specifically looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, let me see when \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2 b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficients for \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part are independent of the second part? Hmm.\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just the same as in the first part? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in it. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then when expanded, each term would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\).\n\nSimplifying that, each term would be \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), that means I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I found earlier.\n\nNow, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything? Or do I need to consider specific terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, making it a constant term?\n\nWait, no. Because in the entire product, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products where the first part gives \\(a^2 b^2\\) and the second part gives any term. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion's value.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct either because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2 b^2 c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), not \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Or does the second part contribute a factor that affects the coefficient?\n\nWait, no. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand it, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is not just 6, but 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2 b^2 c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), not \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms?\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with coefficients that are binomial coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check that again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), but in the product, \\(a^2 b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, there isn't a single term \\(a^2 b^2\\); instead, there are terms like \\(a^2 b^2 c^6\\), \\(a^2 b^2 c^4\\), etc. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\) in the product, which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively.\n\nSo, in that case, I need to consider how the exponents of \\(c\\) work in the second expansion. Let me think again.\n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, for each term in the second expansion, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, to get a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term in the second expansion where \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that would mean the coefficient is 120. But earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that would actually give the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, which is not what we want. Instead, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is a specific term.\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), but since the entire expression includes \\(c\\), it's more precise to say the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\). So, the way to find this is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The only term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term, which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(c^0\\). So, that term has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2 b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product would have some power of \\(c\\). So, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2 b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, each term in the product would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems conflicting with the earlier thought where I considered \\(c^0\\). I'm getting confused here. Let me try to approach this more systematically.\n\nThe expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this is equal to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).\n\nSo, the product is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first sum is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). So, for the term \\(a^2 b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) would be \\(6 - 2m\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible values of \\(m\\) that contribute to \\(a^2 b^2\\). But wait, no, because \\(a^2 b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so each term in the product where \\(a^2 b^2\\) appears will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2 b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2 b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, which interpretation is correct?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the other variables. But in the product, each term is \\(a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), but the exponent of \\(c\\) would vary depending on \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * (sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)).\n\nBut the sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be the sum of all those products, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me check this with an example. Suppose we have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a^1 b^0\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1 b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\), sum of coefficients is 1 + 1 = 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1 b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nBut if we look at the expanded product: \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a c\\) is 1, \\(a/c\\) is 1, \\(b c\\) is 1, and \\(b/c\\) is 1. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 (from \\(a c\\)) + 1 (from \\(a/c\\)) = 2, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2 b^2\\) is present, multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me see if I can find another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that we're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem is considering the entire product or just the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's likely that the coefficient is being considered in the entire product, so the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product was 2, which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion times the coefficient from the first part. So, applying that, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part has its own coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example earlier, that worked out correctly. So, I think that's the right approach.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 (when \\(c = 1\\)).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, so I'm confused. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, in the example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then I need to find the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which happens when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient in the second expansion for \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. However, since the problem includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it's likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\) in the entire expression. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so in the entire expression, it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384 when considering all powers of \\(c\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm essentially summing all the coefficients in the second expansion, which gives me the total coefficient contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me see if I can find a source or a similar problem to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the problem as two separate parts: the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients that come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got the sum of coefficients as 64, which multiplied by 6 gives 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 384.\n\nSo, I think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 120, so I must have been confused. Let me try to clarify once more.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term.\n\nIn this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all possible contributions from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the same as in the first expansion, because the second expansion is multiplied by all terms. Wait, no, that's not right because the second expansion is a separate polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, in the example earlier, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got the sum of coefficients as 64, which when multiplied by 6 gives 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. Let me try to think of it differently.\n\nSuppose I have two polynomials: P(a, b) = (a + b)^4 and Q(c) = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like a^{4 - k} b^k c^{6 - 2m} for various k and m.\n\nThe coefficient of a^2b^2 in P(a, b) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply P(a, b) by Q(c), each term in P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c). So, the term a^2b^2 from P(a, b) is multiplied by each term in Q(c), which has coefficients from Q(c) as binomial coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product P(a, b) * Q(c) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). The sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I initially thought it was 120, but now I'm convinced it's 384. I think the key is understanding that when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the first expansion is scaled by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is 6 times 64.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion times the coefficient from the second expansion when c^0 is considered. Wait, no, that would be if we were looking for a^2b^2c^0, which is a specific term. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, regardless of c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as two separate expansions:\n\n1. Expand (a + b)^4: terms are a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4.\n\n2. Expand (c + 1/c)^6: terms are c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^4\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I should apply that here.\n\nLet me write down the expansion for \\((a + b)^4\\). According to the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAlright, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nHmm, so maybe I should expand both parts separately and then multiply them together? But that seems complicated because both expansions have multiple terms. However, the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the ones that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider how the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) interact, as long as I'm only focusing on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts.\n\nWait, that might not be entirely accurate. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider the entire coefficient from the second expansion and multiply it by 6.\n\nWait, no. That can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But I'm not sure. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, when we multiply this term by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a constant multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a factor to the coefficient, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as long as the term in the second expansion is a constant (i.e., when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the product have variables besides \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which we don't care about.\n\nWait, so perhaps I'm only interested in the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that is purely \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term from the second expansion (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they would contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation of the constant term again. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I think that's more complicated because it would involve considering each term separately, which might not be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as treating the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficients would indeed multiply.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the case. Let me try to verify with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from \\(a\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the entire product would have terms like \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe my approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so in that simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't just 2, because when you multiply \\(a\\) by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) isn't just a number, but it's \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\).\n\nBut in the original problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (some term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to sum over all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems way too high, and I know that the constant term is 20, which would give 6 * 20 = 120, which is different.\n\nWait, so I'm confused now. Which approach is correct?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion where I considered only the constant term.\n\nWait, but in the simpler example I had, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) when \\(c = 1\\). But in reality, when \\(c = 1\\), \\((c + 1/c) = 2\\), so the product becomes \\((a + b)(2)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which matches the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify what exactly is meant by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If the problem is asking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems off because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term has its own coefficient, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, but that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify what exactly is being asked. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), each multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply these two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with coefficient 384, but that seems incorrect because each term in the second polynomial has different powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually multiplied by each of those terms, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone, without considering \\(c\\), would be the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by 6, which is 384.\n\nBut that seems off because when we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, we usually consider the term along with its variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, let me try to think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The term \\(a\\) would be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is not a constant; it's a term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), not just 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a constant.\n\nWait, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems odd because usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term along with its variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), it's implied that it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), unless specified otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the variables. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in the product, the only way to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the other factor, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThat makes sense because if we don't require \\(c\\) to be zero, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But if we're only interested in the term where \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, then it's 120. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut given that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see how the terms combine.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 * \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, depending on the interpretation, the answer could be either 384 or 120.\n\nWait, but the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so without any mention of \\(c\\), I think it's more appropriate to consider that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should check with specific values. Let's assign specific values to \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) and see what happens.\n\nLet me set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\). Then, the original expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\).\n\nNow, if I consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 384, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would contribute 384 when \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 1\\), so 384 * 1 * 1 = 384. But the total value is 1024, which is much larger. So, that doesn't necessarily confirm anything.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (2)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384, which is the same as before. So, when \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nBut if I set \\(c = 1\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 384, but the total expression evaluated at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\) is 1024, which is \\((2)^4 * (2)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). So, 384 is part of that, but the problem is asking for just the coefficient, not the evaluated value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if I can find a different approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that combine the variables from both polynomials. But in this case, we're only looking for a term that involves \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products.\n\nWait, perhaps it's helpful to think of the expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product of the coefficients from each polynomial gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the answer is 120, because it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to think of it another way. If I were to collect like terms in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in each term where the second polynomial contributes a constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I think I should break it down into parts and tackle each part separately. Maybe I can use the binomial theorem here?\n\nFirst, let me recall the binomial theorem. It states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this theorem to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. Then, maybe I can multiply the results together and look for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, when I multiply the two expansions, I'll get terms involving both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as well as \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Is that right? Let me think.\n\nNo, actually, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and then multiply it by the entire second expansion? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiply it by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, how does that affect the coefficient? I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion with a coefficient, say \\(C\\), and then I multiply it by another term from the second expansion, which has a coefficient \\(D\\), then the resulting term will have a coefficient \\(C \\times D\\). But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the exponent is zero, then \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term is a constant, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If the exponent of \\(c\\) is non-zero, then the term will involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nOkay, let me try to formalize this. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), right? Because in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). So, \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is equal to 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. How do I find that? Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is indeed 6. That seems correct.\n\nNext, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), finding the constant term. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. That seems correct too.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me think again about the multiplication. When I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, including the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. So, that should be the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering generating functions or something else, but I think the method I used is straightforward and correct. So, I think the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n\\]\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nSince we're dealing with \\((a + b)^4\\), let's expand that first. The expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let's find which term that is. If we set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does this part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because any other term involving \\(c\\) would make the term have a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out.\n\nSo, let me think about that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from both parts. So, it's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nCalculating that, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, as I found earlier. Then, in the other expansion, the constant term is 20, so when we multiply these together, it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut hold on, is that the entire story? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term (20) in the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut does any other term in the first expansion, when multiplied by a term in the second expansion, result in an \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, I don't think so, because the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If we think of this as a product of two independent expansions, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the part of the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product as a single expression and look for the coefficient. Let's see, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms with powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the cross terms will involve both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) terms. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the only way to get that is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about the multinomial theorem or something else. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, again, that would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to write it out more formally.\n\nLet me denote the first polynomial as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and the second as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). \n\nWe are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). Since \\(Q(c)\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when we multiply it by \\(P(a, b)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply this by \\(Q(c)\\), we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\). \n\nBut \\(Q(c)\\) has terms involving \\(c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the product \\(6a^2b^2 \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nHowever, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, we are looking for the coefficient when the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear without \\(c\\) is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which is the term where \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) (constant term of \\(Q(c)\\)). \n\nAs calculated earlier, the constant term of \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering generating functions or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two generating functions and see how the coefficients multiply. But I think that would lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAnother thought: maybe I can consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since one polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other is in \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, we just need to multiply the coefficient from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), so the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about whether the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion or just in the product. But I think it's in the product, so yes, 120 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider expanding both parts and multiplying, but that seems time-consuming. Let me try expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) a bit more.\n\nExpanding \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\nThe general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(m=0\\): \\(\\binom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(m=1\\): \\(\\binom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(m=2\\): \\(\\binom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(m=3\\): \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(m=4\\): \\(\\binom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(m=5\\): \\(\\binom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(m=6\\): \\(\\binom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think about how the multiplication works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. \n\nSo, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the two variables are separate, does that mean that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the exponents don't interfere. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any possibility that other terms could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from the second expansion? For example, could a term like \\(a^3b\\) from the first expansion, when multiplied by a term like \\(c^{-1}\\) from the second expansion, somehow result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because that would require \\(a^3b \\times c^{-1}\\) to become \\(a^2b^2\\), which isn't possible because you can't reduce the exponent of \\(a\\) from 3 to 2 by multiplying by a term in \\(c\\). Similarly, you can't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) by multiplying by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should write it all out step by step to make sure.\n\nStep 1: Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nStep 2: Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nStep 3: Multiply the two expansions together.\n\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWe are interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which requires that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. This happens only when \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (20) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nSo, after carefully going through each step and verifying the calculations, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   - The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand this using the binomial theorem. Similarly, the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can also be expanded using the same theorem. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is part of the first expansion, right? So maybe I don't need to worry about the second expansion when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Or do I? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of the two expansions. So when I multiply them together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor? Or does it? Hmm, maybe I should consider both expansions.\n\nWait, no, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when multiplying, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, which would just be a number, right? Or wait, maybe the second expansion can contribute a term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when you multiply, you can't get any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms from the second expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first expansion, and the second expansion's terms would just multiply it, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me clarify: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when expanded, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give me a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But then, that would mean the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present, and it will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^{-k}\\), but since we're not considering the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, I think that's the way to go.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients, I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because that would make each term equal to its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is it correct to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by any term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\) would just be the coefficient of that term in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate term when multiplied by \\(P(a, b)\\). So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the product, it would be \\(\\sum_{i} \\text{(terms from first expansion)} \\times \\sum_{j} \\text{(terms from second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, since each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but another thought: if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that's the right approach. Let me just verify with a small example to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\).\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\).\n\nExpanding, we get: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), wait, in this case, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because in \\((a + b)^2\\), the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 1 each. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my previous method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is zero because the term doesn't exist, and then multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 0 times 2 is 0, which matches.\n\nBut in this case, the coefficient is zero because the term doesn't exist. So, maybe that's a good check.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\).\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^3\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is \\(\\binom{3}{1} = 3\\).\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2\\), the sum of coefficients is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\).\n\nSo, according to my method, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product would be \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\).\n\nLet's compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^2 = c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + (1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^3(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 3a^2b(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + 3ab^2(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) + b^3(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nExpanding, the terms involving \\(a^2b\\) are \\(3a^2b c^2 + 6a^2b + 3a^2b/c^2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 6, because it's the constant term. But according to my method, I thought it would be 12. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 6, but according to my method, it's 3 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 4 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion), which is 12. But that's not matching. So, that means my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. So, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, but according to my method, it's 3 times 4, which is 12. So, that's a discrepancy. Therefore, my method is flawed.\n\nWait, so why is that? Let me see.\n\nIn the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first expansion multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and then summed up. But in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3 in the first expansion, and the second expansion has terms with coefficients 1, 2, and 1 for \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), and \\(c^{-2}\\), respectively.\n\nWait, but when I multiply \\(a^2b\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient becomes 3 times each coefficient in the second expansion, so:\n\n- \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) for \\(a^2b c^2\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) for \\(a^2b\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 1 = 3\\) for \\(a^2b c^{-2}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) (the term without any \\(c\\) power) is 6. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, which is the coefficient from the first expansion (3) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion (2). So, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nSo, that suggests that my initial approach was wrong. I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But in this example, that approach would have given me 3 times 4 = 12, but the correct coefficient is 6. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, I need to adjust my method.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to consider that in the first expansion, the coefficient is \\(C\\), and in the second expansion, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is just the constant term. But wait, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), there is a constant term, which is the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 2 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the first example I thought of, where I had \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all terms from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that contradicts the earlier example where the coefficient was 6 instead of 12.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), that suggests that we're considering all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) and any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum of terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term; it's a sum of terms. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get multiple terms, each with a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, but in the example I did earlier, that approach didn't work because it gave me the wrong answer.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the example, when I had \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 2 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nBut in the problem at hand, we're being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion? Or is it being multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient is the sum of all those coefficients?\n\nWait, no, in the example, when I asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it was 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second expansion. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, in the problem, we're being asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second expansion. So, that seems to confirm that approach.\n\nSo, applying that to the problem: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\), and the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was based on a wrong approach. So, I think this is the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the example again to make sure.\n\nIn the example, \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, which is 3 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 2 (the constant term in the second expansion). So, that works.\n\nIn the problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to make sure. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, which is \\(2^6\\), and if I multiply that by 6, I get 384, but that approach was wrong because in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me try another example to make sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would be the sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first expansion, which is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. But in reality, the terms are \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're just considering the coefficient as a number, it's not a single number but depends on the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're considering all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each such term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but in the example, that approach didn't work.\n\nWait, in the example with \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product was 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the constant term. But if I had considered the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 4, and multiplied by 3, I would get 12, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that the correct approach is to multiply by the constant term, not the sum of coefficients.\n\nTherefore, in the problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion, which would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, in the example, that would be 3 times 4 = 12, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) was 6, so that approach is wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by another specific term in the second polynomial gives a term in the product. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), but if I multiply by other powers of \\(c\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, so that suggests that it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, that approach didn't work. So, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me look up the problem to see if it's similar to any standard problems. I think the standard approach is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial multiplied by another specific term in the second polynomial gives a term in the product. So, if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), you need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those contributions, which is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in the example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, in the example, \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) in the product is 6, which is 3 times 2, where 2 is the constant term in the second expansion. So, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) is 3 times the constant term in the second expansion. But if I use the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 4, and multiply by 3, I get 12, which is incorrect. So, that suggests that the correct approach is to multiply by the constant term, not the sum of coefficients.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number.

So, 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me try to compute the product in the problem and see.\n\nWait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the constant term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion gives \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is a term in the product. Additionally, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all other terms in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, but that would be 6 times 64 = 384, but in the example, that approach didn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when you have multiple variables, the coefficient is considered in the entire product, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in different terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, 6 times 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) was 6, which is 3 times 2, not 3 times 4.

If it's the former, then the coefficient is 6 times 64 = 384. If it's the latter, then it's 6 times 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut in the example, when I asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the correct answer was 6, which is 3 times 2, not 3 times 4.

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should consider each part separately. The expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms at all because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps I can just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, since we're multiplying the two expressions together, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that part. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the two parts independently and then just multiply the coefficients. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term, which when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give a term without \\(c\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is something I can calculate using the binomial theorem. Similarly, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term. So, yes, that approach seems correct.\n\nOkay, let's tackle the first part: finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for \\(n = 4\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, in the binomial coefficients: for \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(c^{6 - 2\u00d73} = c^0\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that's fixed, and for \\(c\\), we want \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Thus, the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here.

Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but we're only interested in the terms where the variables don't interfere. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those on \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) has an exponent of 0, so that it's just a constant term. That would make more sense because otherwise, if we consider all terms, the coefficient would be 384 as I thought earlier. But maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. Hmm, that might be a more precise interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, the term would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so it's just a constant. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense when talking about coefficients in a product of polynomials.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6.\n\nSo, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), as I had earlier. We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, so that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was if we were considering all terms regardless of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is specifically asking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nLet me verify this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a term \\(6 * 20 a^2b^2 = 120 a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the binomial coefficients. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when the exponents on \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in a constant term, so that the term is purely \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. So, the answer would be 120.\n\nWait, but I should check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. Let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, in this case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms are \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) from the first part. Now, for the second part, we can have any \\(m\\) such that \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is present, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to my earlier thought where I considered only the constant term. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. Let me try to see which interpretation is more likely. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product, the term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But when we talk about coefficients, usually we mean coefficients of specific monomials, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, making it a constant. That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems less likely because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense in the context of a single coefficient value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem might be expecting just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit odd because coefficients are usually constants, not polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply expecting the product of the coefficients, treating the two parts independently. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, maybe I should try expanding a bit more carefully. Let's consider the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nExpanding each part separately:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut the problem asks for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in this context would be the entire polynomial I just wrote. But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the constant term in the coefficient, which would be 120, as that's the term where \\(c^0\\) is present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be the entire polynomial. But I think that's not the case. The problem probably wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are constants. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if I can find a different approach. Maybe using generating functions or considering the multinomial theorem. But since the problem is a product of two binomials, perhaps it's better to handle each part separately.\n\nWait, another thought: Since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all powers of \\(c\\), but that's not standard.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, as each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, giving a total coefficient of 384 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and you multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, which has various powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, but that's the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial times 6.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second polynomial, which would be 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). Therefore, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and each term corresponds to a specific power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), then it's that entire polynomial.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that combine to form that term.\n\nIn this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, that would mean that the coefficient is 384, but that's if we're considering all powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, if we're only considering the constant term in \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 384.\n\nBut I'm getting confused because the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, maybe I should consider that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just says \"the coefficient\", implying a single value.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when expanding the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times each term in the expansion, giving the coefficient as \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. It's more likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\) = \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because in the product, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 1, same with \\(a\\). So, perhaps that's a bad example.\n\nWait, let me take another example. Let's say \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding, we get:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\) = \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + 2abc^2 + 4ab + 2ab/c^2 + b^2c^2 + 2b^2 + b^2/c^2\\).\n\nNow, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, in this expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c\\) from the second. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first polynomial, but in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second polynomial, it's spread across different \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, but multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, I don't see a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe that's because the first polynomial is only squared, so it's \\((a + b)^2\\), which gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). So, when multiplied by the second polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because the first polynomial doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps in the original problem, since the first polynomial is to the 4th power, it does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which when multiplied by the second polynomial's terms, gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed expansion, I saw that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the second polynomial. So, perhaps that's the answer. But I'm still a bit unsure.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the two polynomials are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product, which is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, so 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems correct because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because in the problem statement, it's written as \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps it's expecting the coefficient to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384, but that's the sum of all coefficients. Wait, no, 64 is the sum of all coefficients, so 6 * 64 is 384, which would be the sum of all coefficients when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps using generating functions or considering the entire expansion.\n\nWait, another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", implying a single number. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written without considering \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so that would be 6 times the entire second expansion, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large, and I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem just says \"the coefficient\", which usually refers to a constant.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term has \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), as each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to see if that makes sense. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would be that polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", so perhaps it's expecting the entire polynomial, but that seems too involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the constant term, so 120. But I'm not sure. I think I'll go with 120 because that seems more likely, considering that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and perhaps it's expecting the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is 384. But if I set \\(c\\) to something else, like \\(c = t\\), then the coefficient would be a function of \\(t\\).\n\nWait, but the problem isn't setting \\(c\\) to a specific value, so perhaps the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too complicated, and I think the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term of the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is 384, which is 6 * 64. So, perhaps the problem is expecting 384.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of another way. Maybe using generating functions or considering the problem as a product of two independent variables.\n\nWait, another approach: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so perhaps that's not the right approach. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6\\).\n\nBut that seems too involved, and I think the problem is expecting a single numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I should conclude that the coefficient is 120, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but I'm still not"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\binom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients, which are the numbers in front of each term. \n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, plugging these back in:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how that multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(A\\), I need to see how \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) interact when multiplied together.\n\nWait, but \\(A\\) contains terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while \\(B\\) contains terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in \\(B\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can come up in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(B\\) that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when we multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) will just be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we need to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), right?\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in \\(A \\times B\\) that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(B\\) only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) will just be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients that are the same as in \\(A\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when you multiply by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is just a term with coefficient 6. When we multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\(A\\) will just be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from \\(B\\) and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But is that accurate?\n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When we multiply by \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(B\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5 \\times 6\\), etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\), multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(B\\) contributes its own coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(B\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 \\times (1/c)\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply by 6, you get 6 times each of those coefficients, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all those terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think. The sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be missing something.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(A\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\).\n\nWait, but that seems to make sense because each term in \\(B\\) contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, then 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nBut wait, I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe I should consider the entire product and see how the terms interact.\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\(A\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nSo, since the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when variables are involved, you have to be careful. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) are just scaled by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), but that might not be the case. Wait, no, because \\(c\\) is separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let's think about a simpler case. Suppose \\(A = a + b\\) and \\(B = c + 1/c\\). Then \\(A \\times B = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(A\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 2 (since when \\(c=1\\), \\(B = 2\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct because in the product, \\(a\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), giving \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, if \\(A = a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(B\\) has sum of coefficients 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{terms involving } c\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any negative signs or something. The term \\(1/c\\) is positive, so all coefficients in \\(B\\) are positive, so the sum is indeed 64.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the sum of its coefficients. Let's do that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is indeed 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be affected by terms in \\(B\\) in a way that changes its coefficient? For example, could there be cross terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something that affects its coefficient? But no, because \\(B\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is just multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire product \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(B\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the product as a single expression and see how the coefficients combine. But I think the approach I've taken is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n3. Calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check with a smaller exponent to see if the logic holds. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) would expand to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 2. So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, that seems to confirm the approach.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Expanding \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 times the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So, 2 * 4 = 8. Let's see: the product is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(2ab\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\) gives \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 * 4 (since the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is 4). Wait, that's 2 * 4 = 8, but in the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, so in this case, my earlier approach gave 8, but the actual coefficient is 4. So, that means my approach was wrong.\n\nWait, so that's a problem. In this smaller example, my method gave the wrong result. So, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, let me recast that. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\). So, according to my earlier approach, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product would be 2 * 4 = 8. But when I actually expand the product, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, not 8. So, that indicates that my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong? Let me think again.\n\nIn the smaller example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 4, not 8. So, my initial approach overcounts by a factor of 2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the coefficient of a specific term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the overall coefficient is not simply the product of the coefficients. Instead, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\). But in the small example, that would be 2 * 4 = 8, but the actual coefficient is 4. So, that's inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coefficients combine. Let me think about it differently. When you have \\(A \\times B\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is the sum over all terms in \\(A\\) of (coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by coefficient of corresponding term in \\(B\\)). Wait, no, that's not quite right because \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are separate variables.\n\nWait, no, in the small example, \\(A = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(B = (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(2ab\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), giving \\(2ab c^2 + 4ab + 2ab / c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 4, which comes from \\(2ab \\times 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nAh, so I see now. I was mistaken earlier. The coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is not the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), but rather the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\). Because when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but the only term in \\(B\\) that contributes to the coefficient of \\(ab\\) (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero) is the constant term in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in the small example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 2 (the middle term in the expansion), so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), because that's the only term in \\(B\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\) and thus allows \\(a^2b^2\\) to have a non-zero coefficient in the product.\n\nWait, that seems to make more sense. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier answer of 384. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\) instead of just the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, in the small example, I saw that the correct approach was to multiply the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), not the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense now. So, I think I was confused earlier because I was considering all coefficients in \\(B\\), but actually, only the term where \\(c^0\\) contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me verify this with the small example again to make sure.\n\nIn the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in \\(A\\) is 2, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(ab\\) in the product is 2 * 2 = 4, which matches the actual expansion.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20, so the coefficient in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\nAs I did earlier, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is indeed 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, my initial approach was wrong because I considered the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), but actually, only the constant term in \\(B\\) affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion, and then considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with expansions, the binomial theorem is really useful. Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficients from each expansion multiply together, and the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nLet me try to tackle each part separately. First, I'll expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). Therefore, the expansion will be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nI need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. Let me write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWait, so each term in this expansion is \\(\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think we need to consider the constant term in the second expansion because multiplying by a constant won't change the variables.\n\nWait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with variables, but in the product, each term will have variables from both expansions. So, actually, if I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nTherefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will multiply the constant term 20 from the second, giving \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a product of two separate expansions and consider the coefficients. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (which is 20) will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have extra \\(c\\) factors, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is there another way to approach this? Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, but I think the method I used is correct. Let me see if I can spot any mistakes.\n\nWait, another thought: when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables match. But in this case, the variables are separate: \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the first, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second. So, when we multiply, the variables are independent. So, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m (1/c)^n\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^l c^{m - n}\\). So, if we want a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero, i.e., \\(m - n = 0\\), so \\(m = n\\). Therefore, the term comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^m (1/c)^m\\) from the second, which is \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each expansion for those terms. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product and look for the coefficient. But that might be more complicated. Let me try to see.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and then consider the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, when we multiply these, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps using generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the generating function would have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). When we multiply these two, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where the \\(c\\) exponents cancel out. But that's essentially what I did earlier, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. Let me just verify the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI guess I'm done then. The coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we multiply the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nBut the question is asking specifically about the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the term in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the original question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part affect this coefficient? Hmm, I think not, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2 b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), right?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when we multiply them, the terms from each part are multiplied together. But since \\(a^2 b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get a term involving \\(a^2 b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, so actually, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2 b^2\\) by the constant term, you just get \\(a^2 b^2\\) multiplied by that constant, so the coefficient becomes the product of the two coefficients.\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the original expression is the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2 b^2\\) from the first part can only combine with the constant term from the second part to give a term that is \\(a^2 b^2 \\times\\) (constant). So, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the two coefficients: 6 and 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2 b^2\\) when multiplying the two expansions. But since \\(a^2 b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way is to multiply the \\(a^2 b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, that would just be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^0\\), since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought before.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which should be the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nI think that's right. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients? But in this case, since the variables are separate, it's simpler to handle each part separately and then multiply the coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms combine, but I think that would complicate things more than necessary. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere with each other.\n\nWait, another thought: if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2 c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would have to consider terms where \\(c\\) is raised to \\(k\\). But in this case, since it's just \\(a^2 b^2\\), which implies \\(c^0\\), so I only need the constant term from the second part, which is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (exponent of \\(c^0\\)), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me just verify the binomial coefficients again.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2 b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).
