    "text": " Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^{k}\\). So, I can apply this to both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because those are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe I can focus just on expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and then figure out how the other part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nLet me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\), right? So, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that:\n\nIf \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that this term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think of it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire expression is multiplied together, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, maybe it's considering all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's the coefficient multiplied by all possible terms in the other part. Wait, that might not make sense either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire expression is being multiplied, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term from the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, and thus the coefficient would be the sum of the coefficients from each of those terms. But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of multiple terms, each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the \\(c\\) part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for a coefficient, not a coefficient times something else. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire product, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the variables are separate.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the product will have terms that are combinations of terms from each. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any specific power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and thus the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me check. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 = ... + 6a^2b^2 + ... \\) and \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = ... + k c^n + ... \\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expansion).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems plausible, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so each term in the product would have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product with various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those would be the same, because the coefficient from the first part is 6 and the coefficients from the second part vary. Wait, no, because each term in the second part has a different coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is actually considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought the answer was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nThe problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nBut usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, it's considering the entire term, including all variables. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\", that would be clear, but it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's considering all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit strange because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a sum over all those terms. But perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a number multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a scalar. Wait, no, the coefficient is for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check online or recall similar problems.\n\nWait, actually, in problems like this, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables is considered, treating the other variables as separate. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4(c + d)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which still doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the other terms are in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part doesn't influence it. So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think carefully. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this context would mean the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, and now I'm thinking it's 384. I need to clarify.\n\nLet me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2(c + d)^1\\). What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product? Well, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + d) = c + d\\). So, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2d + 2abc + 2abd + b^2c + b^2d\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2c + a^2d\\), which is \\(c + d\\). But since we're treating \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) as separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + d\\), which is a polynomial. But if we're looking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^0\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). But in this case, the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2 (since \\(c + d\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, sum is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + d\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, and the problem is probably expecting a number.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nIt doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so it's ambiguous. However, in standard problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, they usually mean the coefficient when all other variables are set to their exponents, i.e., treating the other variables as separate. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, I'm still not sure. Let me think of another approach. If I consider the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the key here is whether the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) or specifically with \\(c^0\\). Since the problem doesn't specify, it's ambiguous, but I think the intended answer is 120, because in problems like this, they often ask for the constant term with respect to another variable, especially if that variable is in the denominator.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem is about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, so that can't be. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try to compute both ways and see which one makes sense.\n\nFirst, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\):\n\n- From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n- From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n- So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\):\n\n- The coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think about the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 (2)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384, which aligns with the earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, the confusion arises from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + d)^1\\). What's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\)?\n\n- From \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1.\n- From \\((c + d)^1\\), the sum of coefficients is 2.\n- So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nIf I expand it, the product is \\(a^2c + a^2d + 2ab c + 2ab d + b^2c + b^2d\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + d\\), which is a polynomial. But if we're treating \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) as variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + d\\). However, if we're evaluating the coefficient as a number, it's only possible if we set \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) to specific values. But in the original problem, there's no such instruction, so perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second expansion) = 384.\n\nGiven that the problem is from a math problem set, I think it's more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still unsure. Let me try to compute both and see which one makes sense.\n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient would be a scalar multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but if I think of the coefficient as a scalar, then it's 384, but if I think of it as a coefficient for each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be.\n\nI think I need to conclude that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to compute both and see which one is correct.\n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\):\n\n- From \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n- From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n- So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIf I compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\):\n\n- From \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n- From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is 64.\n- So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, and the problem is probably expecting a number.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely sure. Let me think of the problem differently. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * (2)^6 = (a + b)^4 * 64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is 384. But if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), the coefficient is a polynomial.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify setting \\(c = 1\\), so perhaps the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient is a scalar multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't standard. Usually, the coefficient of a term is a scalar, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think the intended answer is 120, because it's asking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making the term independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut I'm still not entirely confident. Let me check another approach. Let's expand both parts and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, because each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the coefficients add up.\n\nBut then, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, the problem is ambiguous, but given the way it's phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but in the expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a sum of terms each multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all those coefficients, which is 384.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm by looking at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\"\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when expanding expressions like \\((a + b)^n\\), we can use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply this here.\n\nLooking at \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it using the binomial theorem. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. But I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.\n\nSo, let me find that term. If \\(a\\) is raised to the power of 2, then \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), their exponents won't be affected by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would give a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't what we want. Wait, no, actually, we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the rest is just multiplied along.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means we're looking for all terms in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that?\n\nI remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the other part). So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a coefficient times c^k, so when multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, it becomes 6 * (coefficient) * a\u00b2b\u00b2c^k. So, all these terms contribute to the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product, regardless of the power of c. Therefore, the total coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 is the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of coefficients in the second, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, and to get the coefficient for a\u00b2b\u00b2, you take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by every possible coefficient from the second part, which is the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the sum of coefficients another way. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of coefficients would be the sum from k=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), which is 2^6 = 64, same as before. So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's accurate. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by Q, will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in Q. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each coefficient in Q gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Let's consider expanding both parts separately and then looking at the product.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms:\n\n- \\(a^4\\)\n- \\(4a^3b\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(4ab^3\\)\n- \\(b^4\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(6 - 2k\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTherefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes that coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as we found earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that by actually computing the sum of coefficients another way. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is equal to the value of the polynomial when all variables are set to 1. So, substituting c = 1 into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember that trick, I could compute the sum by adding up all the binomial coefficients:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhich is the same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.\n3. Multiply these two results: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can also expand this using the binomial theorem. So, that would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the original expression is the product of these two expansions: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. However, since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think those terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately and then multiply the relevant coefficients?\n\nLet me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in that part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just carry the coefficient from the \\(c\\) part as well?\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a sum of coefficients, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that seems too large.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\) multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\), we get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part, for each term, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) must be \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term? Because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\) attached, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6.\n\nWait, so first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being the product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, it's just 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nThe expression is a product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared in the first part, and then see how it interacts with the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply term by term. So maybe I should first expand each part separately and then look for the combination that gives me \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the entire second expansion? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because the second expansion might have multiple terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion? Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we only care about \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), which is from the first part. So perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So perhaps the question is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the way it's written, it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the problem would be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate terms, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that all the terms from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second part has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is an expansion, not a scalar.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So in the entire expansion, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that, but we're only interested in the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a number.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, the expression is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial. So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is possible. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would involve multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but that's not quite right because the second part isn't a scalar; it's an expansion with different powers of \\(c\\). So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Let's first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, the entire expression is this coefficient multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product, i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is possible, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nOkay, so let me proceed under that assumption: find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n\\]\n\nWe're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The first part's coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part's coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. So when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So perhaps I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, a number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a number. So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would require more steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part (\\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is miswritten or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but the answer would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended answer is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part is just a scalar multiple. But that's not correct because the second part is an expansion, not a scalar.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the intended approach.\n\nWait, but actually, when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get the sum of all coefficients, but in our case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. So perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't give a number.\n\nI think I must have misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, proceeding with that, as I did earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So when we multiply them together, we get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, which is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check the steps again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nSecond, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when the exponents from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out. So, in the binomial expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients found in the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, maybe I can apply this theorem to both parts of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nI'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which means I need \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4 - k = 2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad k = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\), I get \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nI notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms from the second expansion can be any term because they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because the second part is being multiplied by the first, which only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part? Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, the second part can be any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part's expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that can't be, because the second part is a sum, not a single term.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing myself. Let me think again. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum, which isn't correct because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. The product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these two sums, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first sum when \\(k = 2\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the second sum. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that happens is if the second term is \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in the second sum, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term in the second expansion that will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20 when \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from both parts, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part).\n\nCalculating that:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because in the first part, we have \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and in the second part, we have a term with \\(c^0\\) which is 1, with coefficient 20. So when we multiply these two terms, \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. But does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120?\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. All other terms in the second expansion will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the term where the second part is 1 contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose I consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4 \\right) \\times \\left( c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term \\(20\\) in the second part is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). The other terms would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\) or \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but hold on again. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all products where the term from the first polynomial is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second polynomial is any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second polynomial has multiple terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct either because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which are separate variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. No, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficient of that term in the first polynomial and the coefficient of the term in the second polynomial that, when multiplied together, gives the desired term. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually expanding the terms. Let's consider the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is when multiplied by the constant term 20. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about whether there's another way to approach this. For example, could I consider the entire product and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are as required.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent binomial expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is determined solely by the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes a factor that is multiplied by it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution is from the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the relevant coefficients in each part and then multiplying them. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is super useful.

So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the given expression, it's a product of two binomials raised to different powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nYes, I think that's right. Because when I multiply out the two expressions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 is still \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other terms would have extra \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors.\n\nSo, I can break this problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). So, the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(2m = 6\\) and \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is the term when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original expression is the product of the two coefficients we found. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems right.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\nMultiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion again.\n\nThe original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Since the constant term is 20, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, since the \\(c\\) terms don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n### Part 1: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2 occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I should look for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nLet me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when we multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only interact with terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that don't involve \\(c\\). But wait, actually, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) only has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\), so there's no constant term. So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6 a^2b^2 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor, provided that the variables multiply appropriately. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's as if we're taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the entire second part, which would mean multiplying by the sum of the coefficients of the second part.\n\nSo, to confirm, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) a bit more carefully.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} c^{6} = 1 * c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} c^{4} = 6 c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} c^{2} = 15 c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} c^{-2} = 15 c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} c^{-4} = 6 c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} c^{-6} = 1 c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have variables, the cross terms might affect things, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion just adds another factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient accumulates all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^{i}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when multiplying these two sums together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) would be the product of the coefficients where \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), times \\(\\dbinom{6}{j}\\) where \\(6 - 2j = k\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(j\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{j}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, some terms might interfere or that I need to consider specific powers of \\(c\\)? But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's correct to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\): that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): that's 64.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see if the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. As I listed earlier, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, +15 = 22, +20 = 42, +15 = 57, +6 = 63, +1 = 64. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAnd \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is definitely 6. So, 6 * 64 is 384. I think that's solid.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So,\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, this becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to figure out what term this will contribute. However, wait a minute, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean I need to find the term in the second expansion that's a constant term (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero)? Because when I multiply the two expansions together, only the constant term from the second part will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, let me find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies 2m = 6 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me compute the binomial coefficient for \\(m = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient for the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The original expression is the product of the two expansions:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen I multiply these two expansions, each term in the first sum will be multiplied by each term in the second sum. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first sum, I can ignore all terms in the second sum except for the constant term (which is when \\(m = 3\\)) because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. When you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term from the second part, so yes, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the constant term from the second expansion. Once I found that, multiplying the coefficients from both parts gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem on both parts.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The binomial coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe binomial coefficient for \\(m = 3\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient for the constant term in the second part is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficients from both parts gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still getting comfortable with these kinds of problems.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let's set up the equation for the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). If I have \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), then for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(b^2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\) into the binomial coefficient, I get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That makes me think that maybe the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will just multiply the coefficient we found from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because that would be the constant term, which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that means the coefficient will be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them out, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would come from the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each. However, since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that would be the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, leaving a constant, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those would contribute to different terms in the product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would leave \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term without any \\(c\\) attached. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that's not how it works because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give me a polynomial where each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. It's possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just part of the product. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product would have terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Using the binomial theorem, the general term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, which would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be if we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that the correct approach is to consider only the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}c^{-n}\\) where \\(m + n = 6\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's referring to the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because that's the only term that would be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), giving 120.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is usually helpful. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLooking at the expression, it's the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a second, \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these are separate variables, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) there. Then, since the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a constant; it's another polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because only then would the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, leaving just a constant multiplier for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me break this down into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final answer.\n\nStarting with the first part: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). The term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I multiply the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nMultiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems right. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nFor the first part, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\nThe term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nFor the second part, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these two coefficients together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient.\n\nI'm specifically looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me think: in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), because the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent on \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nLet me compute that binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem also involves \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's separate from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. However, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can treat these two parts independently.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, when we multiply by the other expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 1? Hmm, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, but does that make sense? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and to get a term without \\(c\\) in the product, we need to multiply it by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will be the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part). So, multiplying them together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply it by the term in the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times (c^0) \\), that would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1 = a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product being a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we find \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at each part of the expression separately. The entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that this term must come from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, maybe I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how it interacts with the other part.\n\nWait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. However, since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to realize that since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is the same as the value of the second expression when \\(c = 1\\). Hmm, maybe that's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider how the other part contributes. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting with \\((a + b)^4\\), I know that the expansion can be done using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, applying this to \\((a + b)^4\\), each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nI need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not right because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's effectively asking for the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will just add a factor of that coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second expansion, and each such combination will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, any term in P, like \\(a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by any term in Q, say \\(c^k\\), will give a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively adding up all possible coefficients from Q.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in Q is Q evaluated at c=1, which is 2^6=64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's effectively the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interact differently. Let me try a different approach to confirm.\n\nSuppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so its coefficient is 6. Now, when I multiply this by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the second part will multiply the 6, effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Let's check: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2 when you set c=1. So, that seems to check out.\n\nSimilarly, if I take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2}=1\\). The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1*2=2. Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiplying by \\(c + 1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so when considering all terms, the coefficient is indeed 2 when c=1. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, you want the exponents of \\(c\\) to cancel out, i.e., \\(c^k \\times c^{-k} = c^0\\), but actually, in this case, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe that's not the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to realize that in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m, n\\) are exponents such that \\(k + (4 - k) = 4\\), but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the product as a polynomial in three variables, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and realize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which is why it's 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe I should just compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product by considering that it's the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, which as we said is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as we had before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term could interact with the \\(c\\) terms in such a way that affects the coefficient? I don't think so because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, so their exponents don't interfere with each other. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed just the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the second part contributes its entire sum of coefficients.\n\nSo, after going through this, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), this is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), I can write it as the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it?\n\nWait, but hold on, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, which are different variables, maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, perhaps when you multiply out the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense either. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are not just the product of the sums, unless you're looking for the coefficient of the constant term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), but we only want the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(k = m\\), so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of the products of the coefficients from each expansion where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) result in a constant term.\n\nSo, let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, as I found earlier. Now, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, for the product to have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term of the second expansion to be zero. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the term in the second expansion where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 6} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the key was that when multiplying the two expressions, only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., result in \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me just double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the middle term, and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that's correct.\n\nNext, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). To get the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so the coefficient is 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The corresponding term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the coefficient of the constant term is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Using the binomial theorem, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the terms will be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 = 1 \\cdot a^4 \\cdot 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 = 4a^3b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 = 4ab^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot b^4 = b^4\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, that part makes sense. I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, I have another part of the expression multiplied by this, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. But here's the thing: the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) are only in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them together, the variables are separate. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the variables don't interfere with each other. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the variables in the two polynomials are different (one has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), the variables won't combine in a way that affects each other. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but none of those terms will change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part because they involve \\(c\\) instead. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., but none of these will affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself because they all have additional variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the coefficients are scalar values, not expressions. \n\nHold on, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the two polynomials are in different variables, the variables don't interact when multiplying. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's treating the expansion as a single term, which it's not. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Since the variables are separate, when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, but each of those products will have different variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you distribute, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me check. If I have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times \\left( \\text{something} \\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in } \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is separate, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't directly affected because all the terms will have additional variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually zero because none of the terms in the product will have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right either because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying that it exists. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut let's think about it more carefully. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since the variables are separate, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the variables don't interfere, each multiplication will result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut wait, let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's effectively 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire expression, we take the coefficient 6 and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But let's compute it explicitly: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's not a numerical coefficient but an expression. So, maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it wouldn't appear in the product unless \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which they don't. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but still, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that suggests that I'm misunderstanding something. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would make it 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too complicated, and the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me explore that possibility. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), or just the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power? \n\nI think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI need to figure out which interpretation is correct. Let me look at the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut wait, in the example I did earlier with \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, then the answer would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem seems to be asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all terms and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, it's understood that you're looking for the coefficient of that term regardless of other variables. \n\nWait, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. \n\nBut to confirm, let me think about the definition. The coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power, like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can use the binomial theorem to expand it. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't necessarily need to expand the entire expression, just focus on the parts that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Also, since the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), but since we're only looking for a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply along, but since they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, perhaps they can be considered as a separate factor.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms from the second expansion will just multiply along as constants, right? Or maybe not, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, but since they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at some point? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to recognize that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will only come from the product of terms in each expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expansion that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would not be part of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). So, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the product again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply them, I get 6 * 20 a^2b^2, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 * 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term involving \\(c\\) would not contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), so only the constant term from the second expansion would affect it. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, because the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\) and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\).\n\nUsing the binomial coefficient, that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\).

So, the coefficient here is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this term interacts with the other part of the expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, so the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider all the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), unless they somehow affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the other expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the other expansion, because each term from the other expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of its coefficients. To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64. Let me compute that: 6 * 60 = 360, and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm correct here. Because in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I substituted \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), which seems correct. Alternatively, I could expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and sum the coefficients, but that would take longer. But let me just check with one term.\n\nFor example, the expansion would have terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), since each term's coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and the sum of binomial coefficients is \\(2^n\\).\n\nTherefore, my calculation seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part involves \\(c\\), perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the sum of coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute the product of the coefficients from each expansion for that specific \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of 6 and 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of the coefficients, substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I realize that this part doesn't directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so maybe I don't need to expand it fully.

Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. \n\nBut let me think again. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the other variables, we might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. \n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), etc. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean that in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because any term from the second part would introduce a factor involving \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that seems contradictory. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, in the product, the only term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. But does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term? Let me check.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) will be zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which happens when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term 20 from the second part, I get \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which was 6. So, 20 * 6 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression raised to a power like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both parts of the expression, right?\n\nLet me start with the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, this should expand to the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Got that part.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand this as well. Again, using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWait a second, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, does that mean that the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is multiplied by the first part. So, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, the terms from each expansion will multiply together. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms from each will combine independently.\n\nBut the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to consider all the terms in the product where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it just contributes a factor that gets multiplied by the coefficients from the first part.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) raised to different powers, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part could be anything because it's a different variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and we can't just multiply a single coefficient by the entire sum.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I can consider that in the product of the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term from the second part, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each with a coefficient and a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) power. But in reality, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, so its coefficients are for different powers of \\(c\\). But when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion will have a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so when we multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second part is 6 times each coefficient in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we have to consider all possible coefficients from the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms are independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5 \\times 1/c = 6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, all the way to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), and then the negative powers of \\(c\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\) would be the sum of all those coefficients multiplied by 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean we're summing all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiplying by 6.\n\nSo, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion manually. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n- \\(c^6\\): coefficient 1\n- \\(6c^5 \\times 1/c = 6c^4\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(15c^4 \\times 1/c^2 = 15c^2\\): coefficient 15\n- \\(20c^3 \\times 1/c^3 = 20\\): coefficient 20\n- \\(15c^2 \\times 1/c^4 = 15c^{-2}\\): coefficient 15\n- \\(6c \\times 1/c^5 = 6c^{-4}\\): coefficient 6\n- \\(1 \\times 1/c^6 = c^{-6}\\): coefficient 1\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the second part could contribute differently, but no, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering all possible terms from the second part. So, yeah, 384 seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((x + y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, I can apply this to both parts of the given expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nStarting with \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I want the term where the exponents of both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\).

So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms because they're separate variables. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, actually, every term in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it doesn't affect the power of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expansion. But that's not correct either because the variables are different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the variables are different. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\((a^kb^{4 - k}) \\times (c^m c^{-6 + m})\\). Wait, no, let's correct that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in that expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - n} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n = \\dbinom{6}{n} c^{6 - 2n}\\). So, each term in the second expansion is a coefficient multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter for that specific term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term where \\(c\\) is raised to any power, but since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything, but it's multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be obtained by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds another factor to the coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the polynomial gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's calculate that.\n\nSubstituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. So, the product of two polynomials is such that each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as we found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial's sum of coefficients is 64, and the first's coefficient is 6, the product is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that means I'm looking for all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating all variables together, but that would require considering terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present along with some power of \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that also seems off because the sum of coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, since I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to look at the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that's not how it works when combining with other variables.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} c^m (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are such that \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that term is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single coefficient because it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I think that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term with respect to \\(c\\).\n\nSo, to clarify, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all variables, but specifically where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, let me break it down. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as first expanding each part separately and then multiplying the terms.\n\nWait, more accurately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). Similarly, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the general term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, so that would mean \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, I also need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero because I want the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in the second part is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this part is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
