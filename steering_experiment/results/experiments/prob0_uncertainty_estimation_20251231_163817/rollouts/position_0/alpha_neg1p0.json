    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations.\n\nSo, in this case, the first part of the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me write out the expansion of that. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficients for each term would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), so the term is \\(a^4\\).\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), so the term is \\(4a^3b\\).\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), so the term is \\(4ab^3\\).\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\), so the term is \\(b^4\\).\n\nSo, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nNow, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product.\n\nLet me think: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nActually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which involves powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so unless the problem is asking for the coefficient in terms of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, so when you multiply by the second factor, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), you'd get terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those would still be 6 times the respective coefficient from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term in the expanded form, so if you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would involve terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous unless it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not standard because in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some \\(c^k\\), but the way it's phrased, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, but actually, from 6 down to -6, but only even exponents because each term is \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) would be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6.\n\nBut when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). That doesn't make much sense because in the product, each term has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, perhaps the problem is misphrased, or perhaps it's intended to consider only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, ignoring the \\(c\\) part, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that approach. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and considering all possible terms, but perhaps only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which would be the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nLet me think again: when you have two separate products, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second factor. So, in the first factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second factor, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first factor, and when you multiply it by each term in the second factor, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second factor, because each term in the second factor is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second factor, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut that seems a bit counterintuitive because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second factor becomes a separate term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the sum of all coefficients in the second factor multiplied by 6, because each term in the second factor contributes to a term in the product that includes \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. Let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm considering the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it's actually the sum of the coefficients from the second factor, which is \\(c + 1/c\\). But that's a bit abstract.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as evaluating the product at \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second factor. But I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me verify this with a smaller example to see if this approach makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) (i.e., \\(a^2\\)) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients from the second factor. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is \\(2c + 2/c\\), which is 2 times the sum of coefficients from the second factor. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed the sum of coefficients from the second factor, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 2 times 1 (the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first factor) is 2, which matches the sum of coefficients in the second factor.\n\nWait, but in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is equal to the sum of coefficients in the second factor, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first factor) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in the second factor). So, this seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is indeed the sum of coefficients in the second factor multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first factor. So, that approach seems valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first factor) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second factor, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, given the way the problem is phrased, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, and when you multiply it by each term in the second factor, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second factor multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the structure of the product. The product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Each term in the product is of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second factor, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second factor, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second factor, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 120, assuming that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, ignoring the \\(c\\) part, which would make the coefficient 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second factor, which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all products of coefficients from the first polynomial and the second polynomial such that the variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But in this case, the second polynomial involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be a constant. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that's the correct interpretation. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me verify this by calculating the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so 6 - 2m = 0, which gives m = 3. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of binomial expansions, but I think I can figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem, which says that each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, maybe I can apply that here for both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is specifically in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate part. So maybe I don't need to worry about the c terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that makes sense because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part, which are multiplied together.\n\nSo, let me focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) (since I want \\(a^2\\)), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part, but wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expansion, and it's being multiplied by something from the second expansion, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing their own coefficients.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Is that correct?\n\nLet me check. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients combine in a certain way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the second part is something like \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\) which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\). But when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by these terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\), which are separate terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire first expansion by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, its coefficient gets multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second polynomial. Wait, but the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. Let me check.\n\nWait, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, does it have a constant term? Let me see. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on c is \\(6 - 2k\\). To get a constant term, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nWait, so that means in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 20. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that term. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all pairs of terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) such that when multiplied, the result has \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have those terms as well, so it wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial was 64, so 6*64=384, but that approach was wrong because it's not the sum of all coefficients, but only the constant term that affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nWait, so to clarify, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be seen as multiplying each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product, it must come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the constant term 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, which is obtained by setting \\(c=1\\). But that's not directly relevant here because we're looking for a specific term in the product, not the sum of all coefficients. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by expanding a bit more. Let's consider the two polynomials:\n\nFirst polynomial: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond polynomial: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this a bit. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I found earlier. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term in the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have those terms as well, so they wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, which is 6*20. Hmm, so that would mean 6*20=120, but now I'm getting confused because I thought it was 20. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the constant term in the second polynomial is 20. So, when you multiply these two terms together, you get 6*20=120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by the constant term (20), giving 6*20=120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would just be 20, but that's not correct because the 6 is the coefficient from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the 20, you get 120.\n\nWait, let me think of it as two separate polynomials. Let me denote P = (a + b)^4 and Q = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, P * Q is the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is 6a^2b^2. In Q, the term that doesn't involve c is 20. So, when you multiply P and Q, the term 6a^2b^2 is multiplied by 20, resulting in 120a^2b^2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, so I think my initial confusion was thinking that the coefficient is just 20, but actually, it's 6*20=120 because the 6 is from the first polynomial and the 20 is from the second.\n\nWait, but let me make sure by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^1 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, the coefficient of a^1b^0 would be 1 from the first polynomial, and the constant term in the second polynomial is 0 because (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c, which has no constant term. So, the coefficient of a^1b^0 in the product would be 1*0=0, which makes sense because there's no constant term in the second polynomial. But if I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^2, then the constant term in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\). So, the coefficient of a^1b^1 in the first polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1}=2\\), and the constant term in the second is 2, so the coefficient in the product would be 2*2=4.\n\nWait, but let me check by expanding. (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. (c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2. So, when multiplied, the term 2ab from the first is multiplied by 2 from the second, giving 4ab. So, the coefficient of ab is 4, which is 2*2=4. So, that approach works.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the constant term in the second is 20, so 6*20=120.\n\nWait, so I think I was correct in the end. The coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6*64=384, but that approach was wrong because the sum of coefficients is when you set c=1, which gives you the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial (6) and multiply it by the constant term in the second polynomial (20), giving 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more by considering the general term in the product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Any term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k} b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). Now, for the second part, we want \\(c^{0}\\) because we don't want any c terms, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m=3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}=20\\). So, the combined coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Let's compute the entire product and see if the coefficient is indeed 120. But that would be time-consuming, but maybe I can check a part of it.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the multinomial theorem, but I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts: expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and considering the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\).

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay, so first off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k=2\\), right? Because then \\(a\\) would be raised to the power of \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(b\\) would be raised to the power of \\(2\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so that part is clear. The coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is about the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should remain 6, right?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're only interested in the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part when multiplied.\n\nSo, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\) (which is 1) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and maybe other terms if there are any, but actually, no, because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c\\), which would be different terms. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by \\(c^0\\) from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, so how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k=3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems right because 6 choose 3 is a known value, 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)).\n\nSo, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When I multiply these together, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 120.\n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake? Let me see. Another way to approach this might be to consider the entire expansion, but that seems unnecessary because the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire expression, \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the product, and it would be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that we are treating \\(c\\) as another variable, and we need the coefficient in the combined expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give us \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, as calculated before.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the only term from the second part that affects this is the constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, if I can find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times that constant term.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not correct because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we take the constant term from the second part, which is 20, and multiply it by 6, giving 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's straightforward.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The term is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nMultiplying the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the \\((a + b)^4\\) part. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), which means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider the entire expansion?\n\nWait, no, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of terms from both expansions. So, when they ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they are considering all possible terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut actually, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that would be the case if we were looking for a specific term that includes both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be in the context of the entire expression. But in reality, in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. However, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number, but rather a polynomial. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which would typically be a numerical coefficient if all variables are considered. \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut wait, in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But if we're just looking for the coefficient as a number, without considering \\(c\\), then we need to sum all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^5 + 15c^4 + 20c^3 + 15c^2 + 6c + 1). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nIn the expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient as a numerical value, then perhaps we need to consider that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe they just want the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the second expansion. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all variables, but that's not possible because \\(c\\) is separate.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they are considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical value. So, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all terms, i.e., the sum of coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, as I thought earlier, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But if they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify, so perhaps the intended answer is 6 * 20 = 120, assuming they want the coefficient when \\(c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps they want the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe they just want the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the second expansion, which is a polynomial.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nWait, let me check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think through the entire process again.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\), which has a coefficient of 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Hmm, let's see. I think I can tackle this by breaking it down into parts.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, for the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), I can expand it using this theorem.\n\nLet me write that out. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). Specifically, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't matter? Or do they? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from the first part and then multiplied by any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression.\n\nWait, that makes sense because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the one where the exponents cancel out, which is when we have \\(c^k\\) times \\(c^{-k}\\) from the two factors. So, the constant term is when the exponents add up to zero.\n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part.

So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part has a constant term of 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, because when you multiply terms, you add exponents. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the expansion is done using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\).

So, I need to find the term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nLet me recall that in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(n - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, in this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we want \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Similarly, for \\(b\\), \\(k = 2\\).

Let me compute that. \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), but since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I might need to consider how that affects the coefficient.\n\nBut hold on, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of the entire expression.

However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will add to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have two separate products, the coefficients of specific terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself unless you consider the entire expansion.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., up to \\(c^{-6}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, and it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. However, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each of those coefficients times their respective powers of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only come from the term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient equal to the product of the two coefficients. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nSo, let me verify that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) comes from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nOkay, so now I need to compute two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me work on the second part now. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, this is a binomial expansion. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\).\n\nSimplifying that, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{k} c^{-(6 - k)} = \\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, let me check that factorial computation again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6*6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we just found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nIs that correct? Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand both parts, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have a different form, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, indeed, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nHmm, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the binomial coefficients. Let me just verify \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) again.\n\n\\(\\binom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4!/(2!2!) = 24/4 = 6.\n\n\\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20.\n\nYes, both are correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider an alternative approach. Suppose I consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that's not the same as the constant term.\n\nWait, no, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, but the constant term is 20, as we found earlier. So, if I were to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384, but that's not correct because that would be the coefficient if we were considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), but in reality, each term is multiplied by a term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the correct approach is to take 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. The product of these coefficients gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I can tackle this by looking at each part separately and then combining the results. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that when you expand \\((x + y)^n\\), each term is of the form \\(\\binom{n}{k} x^{n - k} y^k\\), where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. So in this case, \\(x = a\\), \\(y = b\\), and \\(n = 4\\). \n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a\\) is raised to the power of 2 and \\(b\\) is also raised to the power of 2. So, let's figure out what \\(k\\) should be in the binomial expansion. The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\\). \n\nWait, I want \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the term is \\(\\binom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). That's 4! divided by (2! * (4 - 2)!), which is (24)/(2 * 2) = 24/4 = 6. So the coefficient here is 6.\n\nOkay, so that part is done. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does this mean that I have to multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nWait, why \\(c^0\\)? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\) is the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(n\\) of \\(\\binom{n}{k}x^{n - k} y^k\\). So, here, \\(x = c\\), \\(y = \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), and \\(n = 6\\). So each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).\n\nSimplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720/36 = 20. Wait, that's correct because \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, correct. So when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), giving \\(a^2b^2 * 1 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but hold on, does the entire expression have any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is \\(c^0\\). Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\). So, I think I'm correct in only considering the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then I would have to consider the corresponding terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the two coefficients together because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expression, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} a^2 b^2\n   \\]\n   Calculating the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients of the terms can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is that the entire expression is multiplied by another binomial expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because they're separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the terms involving \\(c\\) might affect it. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you'd be adding up all those coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all the terms from both binomials. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first binomial, and the second binomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests it's a constant. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check again: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second binomial. That would make sense because then you'd have to consider both the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's a misstatement. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me assume that for a moment.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I thought earlier, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2} b^{2}\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the other binomial, so maybe I was right the first time that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, and since the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient would just be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible combinations, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first binomial, the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second binomial. But again, that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which is 6, regardless of the other terms. But that seems too straightforward, and the problem includes the second binomial, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm confused. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms from the second binomial, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), but that would be 384, which seems too large. Wait, but that approach is incorrect because the second binomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term unless we consider specific exponents.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial times the entire expansion of the second binomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, but only looking at the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second binomial. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which we found earlier to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) cancels out, is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe that's not what it's asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial, which is 6, and ignore the second binomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both binomials.\n\nWait, let's think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\"\n\nSo, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first binomial will be multiplied by each term in the second binomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, which is not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial, which is 6, and the second binomial doesn't affect it because it's separate variables. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both binomials, so perhaps that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second binomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second binomial. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but that approach is incorrect because the sum of coefficients is when you set all variables to 1, but in this case, the variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so setting \\(c = 1\\) would give the sum of coefficients, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something like that, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I think the only way to interpret this is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that can't be what the problem is asking for. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first binomial, which is 6, and the second binomial doesn't affect it because it's separate variables. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes both binomials, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second binomial.

Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I must be misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expansion, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean the coefficient is 6, as in the first binomial.

That is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay, so I remember that when you have an expression like \\((x + y)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}x^{n - k}y^{k}\\), right? So maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let me look at the problem again. I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), right? Because the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So maybe I can handle these two parts separately.\n\nOkay, so let me start by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in this expansion will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part when finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, actually, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) terms. So when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So that means we're only looking at the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part, right? Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when we expand this, each term will be of the form (term from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by (term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in \\((a + b)^4\\), so when we multiply it by any term from the second part, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That implies that we're looking for all the terms where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply by the second expression, which does involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, we're looking for all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second polynomial, it will produce a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only possible if \\(k = 0\\), because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it. \n\nWait, but actually, no. The problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So when you multiply them out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^3\\) from the second part, I get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when the second part contributes a term that is \\(c^0\\), because then \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTherefore, I need to compute two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found as 6.\n\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient.\n\nSo, let me compute the second part now: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\(6 - 2k = 0\\)\n\n\\(2k = 6\\)\n\n\\(k = 3\\).\n\nSo the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nWait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)).\n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nThen, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nMultiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think that means I need to consider the product of these two expansions.\n\nWait, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression multiplies each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them together, each term from the first will multiply each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 from the second expression, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by, say, \\(c^3\\), that would give me \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, right?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving different powers of c. So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, I'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, but in the second expansion, is there a term that is 1?\n\nWait, let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of c will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, in the second expansion, the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply the first expansion by the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by 20, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times 6, which is 120.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply those together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20, as we found earlier. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the only term that will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no c terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider whether there are other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, suppose I have a term from the first expansion that's \\(a^3b\\) and a term from the second expansion that's \\(c^{-1}\\), but when multiplied together, that would give \\(a^3b c^{-1}\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, if I take \\(a^4\\) and multiply it by \\(c^2\\), that gives \\(a^4c^2\\), which again isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it seems that only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe I can consider the entire product and see if any other combinations could result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But no, because in the first part, each term has a unique combination of a and b, and in the second part, each term has a unique power of c. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second expansion. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when is the exponent 0? When \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and then look for the term where a^2b^2 is multiplied by some term in the second expansion that doesn't involve a or b. But since the second expansion only involves c and 1/c, which are separate variables from a and b, the only way to get a term with a^2b^2 is to take a^2b^2 from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, that gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and then see how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to a^4b^0 and down to a^0b^4, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}. So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second, but the only way to get a term that's just a^2b^2 is to take a^2b^2 from the first and multiply it by 1 from the second. So, that term is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there are no other terms that could combine to give a^2b^2. For example, if I take a term like a^3b from the first expansion and multiply it by a term like c^{-1} from the second expansion, would that result in a^2b^2? No, because that would give a^3b * c^{-1}, which is a^3b c^{-1}, which isn't a^2b^2. Similarly, taking a^4 and multiplying by c^{-2} would give a^4 c^{-2}, which isn't a^2b^2. So, no, the only way to get a^2b^2 is to take a^2b^2 from the first part and multiply by the constant term from the second part.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product, regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the term a^2b^2 would be present in the product as a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those would have different powers of c. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 c^k would be 6 * (coefficient of c^k in the second expansion). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which would imply that it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by c^0, because otherwise, the term would have a c component. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2 regardless of the c terms, but that seems unlikely because the variables are separate. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's consider the entire product. The term a^2b^2 comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term a^2b^2 * c^6, a^2b^2 * c^5, etc., up to a^2b^2 * c^{-6}. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of a^2b^2 c^k is 6 * (coefficient of c^k in the second expansion). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of a^2b^2, which I think refers to the term a^2b^2, not a^2b^2 multiplied by any power of c. Therefore, the only term that is exactly a^2b^2 is when k=0, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step. I remember that when dealing with expansions like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficients can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\\). So, maybe I can apply that here.\n\nFirst, let me focus on the first part of the expression: \\((a + b)^4\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion. Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because the exponent on \\(b\\) is 2. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a minute, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nI think I need to consider how the multiplication works. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to make sure that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the appropriate term in the second expression.\n\nBut wait, the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(c^k \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^{6 - k}} = c^{2k - 6}\\). However, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). That suggests that I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient just gets multiplied by the coefficient from the second expression.\n\nWait, so if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by a term from the second part that is a constant (i.e., no \\(c\\) involved), then the overall coefficient will be the product of the two coefficients. But if I multiply it by a term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the term would involve \\(c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get a term that is only \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. Once I have that coefficient, I can multiply it by the coefficient 6 from the first part to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\). Simplifying the exponent, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{k - (6 - k)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{2k - 6}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(2k - 6 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first part) multiplied by the constant term (which is 20) will give the overall coefficient in the product.\n\nSo, multiplying 6 and 20, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(2k - 6 = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only combine with the constant term from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which we don't want. So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is why we multiply 6 by 20.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be found using combinations. \n\nIn this problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), so n is 4. So I can expand this part first. Let me write that out. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\binom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\binom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\binom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\binom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\binom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nCalculating each binomial coefficient: \n\n- \\(\\binom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\binom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nOkay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So I need to consider the entire expression, which is the product of two binomial expansions. \n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, that seems right. So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second part is. \n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, each term in the product is a product of a term from the first expression and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term will come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the product will be products like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}(1/c)^m\\), etc. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) makes each term just the coefficient times \\(1\\), so the sum is the sum of the coefficients. \n\nSo, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you have two separate variables, the coefficients for the product would actually involve multiplying each term's coefficient from the first expansion with each term's coefficient from the second expansion, but since the variables are separate, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by every term in the second expansion. \n\nBut that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible combinations where the term from the first expansion is \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion is any term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nBut that would mean that the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for a term that involved both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then we would have to find specific terms from both expansions that combine to give the desired term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first expansion) times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so 1 * 2 = 2. But if I actually expand the entire product, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms are \\(ac\\), \\(a/c\\), \\(bc\\), \\(b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), which is just \\(ac + a/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). \n\nWait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. So maybe my initial approach was wrong. \n\nWait, so in this example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. But in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but in the original problem, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant because the term doesn't involve \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me clarify. \n\nWhen you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is formed by multiplying a term from the first polynomial by a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first polynomial, then in the product, it will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. \n\nBut since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), multiplying it by each term in the second polynomial will give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's looking for the coefficient when the term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that's not possible because the second polynomial has \\(c\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without \\(c\\) is if the second term is 1, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. \n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nSo, it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible terms from the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but in the example I thought of earlier, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum of terms, but in that case, the term \\(a\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nBut in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). \n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, that term doesn't exist because it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is misworded, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the entire expression is a product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me check this again. Let's think about the entire expansion. \n\nThe entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nExpanding this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6, stepping by 2 each time because of the exponents. \n\nSo, the general term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) is from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) is such that the term comes from the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nYes, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the variables of the second polynomial is just the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nSo, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the term involved both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then we would have to find specific terms from both expansions that multiply together to form the desired term. But in this case, since the desired term doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients as I calculated. \n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384. \n\nBut wait, just to be absolutely sure, let me consider expanding the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, the entire product is \\((a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). \n\nNow, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLooking at the first polynomial, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, each term in the second polynomial will contribute a term like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but that's not possible because each multiplication introduces a \\(c\\) term. \n\nWait, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term without \\(c\\), so it's only present once in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\right)\\). \n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is actually the sum of all these coefficients, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would be zero because none of the terms in the second polynomial are constants except for 20. \n\nWait, hold on. In the second expansion, when \\(m = 3\\), the term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = 20c^0 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 20 gives \\(20a^2b^2\\). \n\nBut when multiplied by other terms, like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., they give terms with \\(c\\) exponents, which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the only term in the product that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, which gives \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion), giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 * 64 = 384, but that was when considering all terms. But now, I'm realizing that only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nSo, which is correct? \n\nLet me clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms? \n\nIf it's the former, meaning just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIf it's the latter, meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expression, but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term 20 in the second expansion. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nIn the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. \n\nSo, to get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), you take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by \\(c^k\\) from the second. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then you need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. \n\nSo, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion), giving 120. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any \\(c\\) term, then it would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut the way the problem is phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", typically refers to the coefficient when the term is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), without any other variables. So, in this case, it's 120. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me check an example. \n\nSuppose I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). \n\nIf I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it's zero because there's no term with just \\(a\\). \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it's 120, because that's the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually computing the product. \n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the terms will be: \n\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 15/c^2 = 90a^2b^2/c^2\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6/c^4 = 36a^2b^2/c^4\\)\n- \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^6 = 6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, in the entire expansion, the only term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was a mistake. The correct approach is to realize that only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion), which is 120. \n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120. \n\nBut wait, let me check this again. \n\nIn the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nIn the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be relevant if we were looking for the coefficient of a term that includes both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, it's just 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSo, the final answer is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything else. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. \n\nIn this case, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. \n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) corresponds to \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\). So, in this case, the expression \\((a + b)^4\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I don't need to expand the entire expression, just find the specific term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me see... In the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is another binomial expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) doesn't directly affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right?\n\nWait a second, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two binomials, so when we multiply them out, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how this term interacts with the other part.\n\nBut hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is going to involve powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second binomial expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient will be the same as the coefficient in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate term.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), when I multiply it by the entire second expression, I get \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire second expression, but that doesn't seem right because the second expression isn't a scalar; it's another polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by each term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), and we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a single number. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous. But usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product like this, it's considering the entire product as a single expression, and the coefficient would be a term that's a product of coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a scalar. That seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a scalar.\n\nLet me assume that's the case. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion, which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nOkay, so first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\binom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{6!}{3!3!} = \\frac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\frac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a scalar. So, I think my initial assumption is correct that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nHmm, okay, so I think I need to expand both parts separately and then multiply them together, right? But wait, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to expand all terms. Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's consider the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember that when expanding a binomial like \\((a + b)^n\\), the coefficient of a specific term can be found using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}a^{n - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\).\n\nIn this case, \\(n = 4\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me set up the term:\n\nThe exponent of \\(a\\) is 2, and the exponent of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because in the binomial term \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), when \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of something here as well. Wait, but the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), which are in the first part. So, does the second part affect this coefficient? Hmm, maybe not directly. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), right?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Because when we multiply, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part's terms will contribute a factor, but they won't change the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, we can consider that each term from the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right either. Because the second part isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each term will be 6 times the coefficient from the second part.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, if I'm correct, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is a separate expansion, and when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering all terms in \\(c\\) as part of the coefficient. But that seems odd because coefficients are usually numerical, not expressions involving variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just asking for the numerical coefficient, considering that \\(c\\) is separate. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which also includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is a term that includes powers of \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually numerical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a numerical value, so we need to consider that the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut let me think again: when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the other part. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's only if we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term and considering all the coefficients that multiply it from the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can set \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\). Therefore, the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)].\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a factor to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is likely asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps we need to consider that the second part's expansion is multiplied by 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the second part is part of the entire expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, so the coefficient is 6, and the second part is just a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me check: If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: The problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient from the second part. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's essentially 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps we're to consider that the second part is a separate expansion, and the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is the product, so the coefficient should account for the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second part is a separate polynomial, and when we multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 1. The sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so if I multiply by 2, I get 2 for each term, which is correct because \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) expands to \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2 times the coefficients from the second part, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{1 - k}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{1}{k}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as 6, ignoring the second part, but that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the entire expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering the product of the two expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, I should probably understand what the problem is asking. It wants the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I also need to consider how that part affects the coefficient. But wait, actually, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the entire expression is a product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? Or do I need to consider the entire expansion?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a certain coefficient. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means I only need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and then that coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which would involve both parts.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two terms. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then that's it. Because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that would require looking at all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of other variables. So, perhaps the other part just contributes a scalar factor, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^k\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because usually, when we talk about the coefficient of a term in an expression, we consider only the part that's multiplied by the variables. But in this case, since the expression is a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, that can't be right because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then considering that the other part is separate, so the overall coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times whatever the expansion of the other part is. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a product.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not the usual way such problems are phrased. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is multiplied by it. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering that the product is a single expression. So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6. But that's not a single coefficient; it's an expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times whatever the second part is. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems like a possible approach.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), because when \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are multiplied, the term where the exponents cancel out is when we take three \\(c\\)s and three \\(1/c\\)s, giving \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression has coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expression has coefficient 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what is intended.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number. So, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient in the first part, which is 6, and that's it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. Because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that the product is a single expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. Let me check that approach. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 64 times 6, which is 384.\n\nBut is that correct? Because when \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression simplifies, but does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384? Or is that just the sum of all coefficients multiplied by 64?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's it. Because the second part is a separate factor, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times whatever the second part is. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's an expression, not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and that's the answer. Because the second part is a separate factor, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, and it's multiplied by the entire second part, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, another example: \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion is \\((a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3)(c^2 + 2c \\times 1/c + 1/c^2)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 3 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply the terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 3 * 2 = 6.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\), because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when we choose three \\(c\\)s and three \\(1/c\\)s, which is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut earlier I thought of setting \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients, which gave me 64, and then 6 * 64 = 384. But that approach seems to be incorrect because it's considering all coefficients, not just the one that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and then multiply them to get 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will only be multiplied by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would introduce powers of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\((a + b)^n\\), you can expand it using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem says that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^{k}\\). So, in this case, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^{4 - 2}b^{2} = a^2b^2\\).\n\nCalculating that, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? Because when we multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well, and the variables multiply as well.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the other parts involve \\(c\\) terms which we don't care about.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem correct. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, the terms involving \\(c\\) are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not quite right because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the product, but the other parts involve \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expression, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), thus the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression.\n\nBut wait, let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because when you multiply, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have all possible coefficients from the second expression attached to it.\n\nBut wait, actually, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the terms combine. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5(1/c) + 15c^4(1/c)^2 + ... + \\) etc. So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second expression).\n\nThe sum of coefficients in the second expression is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this another way. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part (which is 64), giving 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm not sure if I'm considering the variables correctly. Let me try another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion's coefficients are \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\), so the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives us \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nAlternatively, another way to see this is that the entire expression can be written as:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{terms involving } c \\right)\n\\]\nSo, when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has coefficients \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\) from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the sum of the coefficients again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^{k}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, perhaps I need to consider the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times terms from the second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, then maybe we can think of it as the coefficient being the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by different terms. But that seems confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should just consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\); rather, each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficient would be multiplied by the coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think. If I have two polynomials, say, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire \\(Q(c)\\), but that seems odd because \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate variable.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it out. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), specifically when we choose 2 a's and 2 b's. The coefficient for that is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and sum their coefficients?\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in multiple variables, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems incorrect because the product would have more terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\( \\binom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2 \\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but treating \\(c\\) as a variable that's not part of the term we're interested in. So, perhaps we can treat \\(c\\) as a constant and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that still doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term is \\(\\binom{6}{k}\\), but since we're multiplying, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high.\n\nWait, no, that approach is incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients don't just multiply the sums. Instead, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any term involving \\(c\\), but that's not clear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. The first is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since they are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a single expression, but that would require combining terms in a way that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the same as in the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that still doesn't make sense because it's not a single number.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a Laurent polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple.\n\nWait, but if I consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, maybe I should just provide the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and note that the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(1\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply by other terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) and 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent to 0, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Hmm, okay, so I think I need to expand both parts and then find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the expression \\((a + b)^4\\). I remember from the binomial theorem that expanding this would give me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, the general term in the expansion is given by \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4.\n\nSince I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\binom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part of the expression: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Similarly, I can apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will have terms where each term is of the form \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expression. The second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless there's a connection between these variables, I think they are independent. That means the terms in the second expression don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) directly. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, their coefficients won't influence the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains the same as in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nBut let me double-check. When I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expression will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the coefficient in the entire product, not just in one part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the same as in the first expression, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expression, right?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. However, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, unless the second expression has a term that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\).\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any condition on \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, including the part from the second expression. Hmm, that complicates things because the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But maybe the problem is considering the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include all the terms from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the combined expression, considering that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each part is raised to different powers.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in that term when multiplied. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part.\n\nWait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the sum over all \\(k\\). But that would be the entire coefficient, which is a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient when multiplied by the terms from the second expression that don't involve \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because the second expression doesn't have a constant term unless \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m=3\\), which is \\(\\binom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the term where the second part is constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nLet me verify that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\binom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\). For \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\binom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The general term is \\(\\binom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) (which is needed to keep the power of \\(c\\) neutral) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\binom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply by something else, it just scales the entire term.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again.

Because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expression, each term in the second expression would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient from the second expression.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first expression, and when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it would produce a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression, because the second expression is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is already a term, the coefficients from the second expression would just scale it. Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each term in the second expression is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, when you collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), you're effectively multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is straightforward using the binomial theorem, and then multiply that by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, let's compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k} b^{k}\\). We want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), and the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Because when you have the product of two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part contributes all possible terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Simplifying the exponents of \\(c\\), we get \\(c^{m - (6 - m)} = c^{2m - 6}\\).\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so the term is \\(a^2b^2\\). The coefficient from the first part is 6, as we found earlier. Then, for each term in the second part, we have coefficients, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is a Laurent polynomial (because of the \\(1/c\\)), the sum of its coefficients is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving 64.\n\nSo, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of coefficients is 64.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each term. The sum of all coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I found earlier. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), hence the total is 6 * 64.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any subtlety. For example, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part, and multiply them. But in this case, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's effectively the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct, and the answer is 384.\n\nBut just to be absolutely certain, let me compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) again. Using the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), so that's correct.\n\nAnd the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, multiplying these together gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. Substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplying the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part.\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
