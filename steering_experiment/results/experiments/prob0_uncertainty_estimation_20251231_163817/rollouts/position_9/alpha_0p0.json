    "text": " Let me see, if \\(a\\) is raised to the power of 2, then \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the term for \\(k=2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, so that term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I just need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part will just be a scalar multiplier when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I can compute the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all the terms in the second expression. But wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we actually need to consider the entire second expression as a single factor when calculating the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you have two independent expressions multiplied together, like \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by the entire expression \\(Q(c)\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically constants. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, coefficients are numerical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4\\), etc. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a numerical value, implying that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two results together to get the final coefficient. Let me check if that makes sense. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, technically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the term where \\(c^0\\), so that the entire coefficient is a number. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems unlikely because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion will be the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if I need to expand this part as well, but since the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about this part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because if there's any \\(c\\) term, then the overall term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second part.

Wait, but actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients would be multiplied as well. Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since it's multiplied by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, regardless of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the two parts are multiplied together, so the coefficients should be multiplied as well. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me try to clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second.

That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because any term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem isn't asking for a specific power of \\(c\\), I can treat the coefficient from the second part as a constant multiplier. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by every term in the second part, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant multiple. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will be a combination of the terms from both expansions. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check the original problem again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most such problems, when variables are present in multiple parts, the coefficient is considered as the coefficient of the term regardless of other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient from the first part is 6, and from the second part, it's 20. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. However, since the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when multiple variables are present and only some are specified, it's implied that the coefficient is for the term where the other variables are at their lowest exponent, typically zero. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check: If I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, meaning 6 times 64, which is 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when multiple variables are present, and you're asked for the coefficient of some variables, it's implied that you consider the term where the other variables are at a specific power, often zero. So, maybe 120 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me look at the problem again: It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven the problem as stated, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe I should interpret it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 times the second expansion, meaning the coefficient is 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me consider an example: Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this:\n\n\\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^1 = c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\).\n\nMultiplying them together:\n\n\\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\).\n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product is zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's a different case because in this case, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 1 each in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\). But in our original problem, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be zero because there's no such term. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think I need to go back to the problem statement and see if there's any indication. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. However, in most math problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of certain variables in a product of expressions with multiple variables, it's often implied that you're considering the term where the other variables are at their lowest power, typically zero. So, in this case, it's likely that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so 120. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me see if I can find any similar problems or reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^4\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of those \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. I think I confused myself by considering the term where \\(c\\) is zero, but actually, the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think that part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but maybe it does affect the overall coefficient? Wait, no, actually, when we multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them out, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that term would be \\(6 \\times a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients when multiplied. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\). But that still doesn't clarify it. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, maybe I need to first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) term. But if the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so it's more likely that we're to consider the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me check my calculations again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (24) / (2 * 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But wait, actually, no. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Or is it something else? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Wait, no. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is just 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, every term in the second expansion will have a corresponding term in the product. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients will add up, but the variables will be multiplied. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all the variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct? Because when I multiply 6a^2b^2 by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients do add up, but the variables will be multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, as I thought earlier. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let me expand both parts separately and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) as we did earlier, gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the terms are:\n- For k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- For k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- For k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- For k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- For k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- For k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- For k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier by substituting c=1. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by each of these coefficients, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need to sum all these contributions. However, actually, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion is 6a^2b^2, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, each of which has different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means that all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding coefficient from the second expansion and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see how the multiplication works. \n\nWe know that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 * c^6\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 * 6c^4\\) gives \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120, and so on. \n\nBut the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all these contributions where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the second expansion's sum of coefficients is 64, as we found earlier, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else? Hmm, but in this case, since we're dealing with two separate binomial expansions, the approach I took seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider the coefficients accordingly. But I think the method I used is solid. \n\nSo, to recap: \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. \n\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\n3. Compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384. \n\n5. Verify by expanding both parts and summing the contributions, which also gives 384. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole product would be 6 times the coefficient of whatever term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that we're considering. But hold on, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can contribute any term, right? But wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that's being multiplied. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only present in the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the second part? But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so it would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you expand the whole thing, the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that each term in the expansion will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term would be 6, but when multiplied by all the terms in the second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). Since the sum of coefficients is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so that's 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then when I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P will be multiplied by each term in Q, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q is a coefficient times some power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all these terms is just the coefficient from P times the sum of the coefficients from Q. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, but that's impossible because the second part has c terms, so when you multiply, every term in P is multiplied by every term in Q, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., but there is no term where \\(c\\) cancels out, unless you have c^0, which is 1. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 would be just \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that's a different approach. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me compute that. \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k: 6 = 2k => k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\" So, when it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering the entire product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where m is from 0 to 6, but actually, the exponents would be more varied. Wait, no, more accurately, each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. It just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In algebra, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term usually refers to the coefficient when considering all other variables as coefficients. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and the coefficient would include the contribution from the other variables. But in this case, the other variables are in the form of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term (without any c terms) would be zero because there's no term with just \\(a^2b^2\\). But if you consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the c terms, then it would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. I think the more likely intended answer is 120 because if you're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, that would make sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning the term where the exponent of c is zero. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me confirm this by thinking about how the expansion works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But given that the problem includes c terms, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any c terms, it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present multiplied by various powers of c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without considering c, would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial times the coefficient from the first. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, so that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 384, but that seems high. Let me think again. Let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. So, which one is correct? It depends on how the problem is phrased. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of c, then it's 384. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem didn't specify any c terms, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, no, that's not correct because in the product, each term is a product of terms from both polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, which includes different powers of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it just says \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first part beyond \\(b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in this small example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the first polynomial only goes up to \\(b^2\\), and the second polynomial is degree 1 in c. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning isn't the best example. Let me try a different example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The product is \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero. \n\nWait, but in our original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which does have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term. So, when multiplied by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible c terms, would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in reality, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is not a single term but is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think the confusion comes from whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms or specifically when c is zeroth power. Since the problem doesn't specify any c terms, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible c terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, when it's written like that, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term has both a and c parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. \n\nI think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible c terms, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering \\(c^0\\). So, which is it? \n\nI think the key is to realize that when the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the coefficient when considering all variables. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. \n\nWait, but let me think about how this works. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). When I multiply them, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from P is multiplied by each term in Q, which is a polynomial in c. So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all k. But that's not a standard way to interpret coefficients. Normally, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would be considered in the context where other variables are set to zero, but in this case, since c is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient when c is set to 1, because that's how you sum all coefficients. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient when you treat c as a separate variable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in Q, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the product. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut to make sure, let me compute it step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: \n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, the terms are:\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n- \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 6a^2b^2c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 15a^2b^2c^2 = 90a^2b^2c^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 20a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 15a^2b^2c^{-2} = 90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 6a^2b^2c^{-4} = 36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(6 \\cdot 1a^2b^2c^{-6} = 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120, which comes from the term \\(6 \\cdot 20a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now, when I list out all the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 120. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. \n\nBut in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible c terms, it's 384. \n\nBut in reality, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific combination of variables is considered in the context of the other variables being zero. But in this case, the other variables are c and 1/c, which are separate from a and b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of the coefficients of all terms where a^2b^2 is present, regardless of the c terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the expansion, when you list out the terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all c terms is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384. \n\nSo, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nBut wait, that contradicts the earlier step-by-step expansion where each term is separate. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is 120, because when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term without specifying other variables, it's usually in the context where the other variables are set to zero, but in this case, since c is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient when c is zero, which isn't possible because c is in the denominator. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 384. \n\nWait, let me check another source or example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that doesn't help. \n\nWait, but in our problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut in the expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so perhaps the answer is 120. \n\nI think I need to make a decision. Given that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any c terms, I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means in the expansion, I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). Yep, that's correct. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will depend on multiplying the corresponding terms from each expansion. But wait, let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), which is separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's not clear if they want the coefficient considering all possible \\(c\\) terms or just the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think that means the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the other expansion, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems complicated. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term from the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but let me check if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that would mean that in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me try a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's sufficient to just find the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then note that the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let's think about how polynomial multiplication works. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) would be multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). So, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\), and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in Q(c) is when c = 1, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me try expanding both parts a bit more to see. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion includes terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but if I think about it differently, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in terms of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. So, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). In the first expansion, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). When I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c) = c + 1/c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which means that the coefficient isn't just 1; it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether they want the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\) or just the numerical coefficient. If they want the numerical coefficient, then perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if they want the coefficient as a polynomial, it would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think they mean the numerical coefficient, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think about how the multiplication works. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's referring to the sum of all coefficients multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the problem is from a textbook or a standard problem. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of two expressions, it's in the entire expanded form. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\). So, in our case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. However, the problem might be asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps considering all \\(c\\) terms. But that's unclear. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient, not specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's just 6. But that seems inconsistent with how polynomial multiplication works. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) parts are just part of the expression but not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients should combine. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, let me try to compute the product step by step. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6*1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times 1) is 6*20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6*15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6*6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6*1 = 6. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 120. But wait, that's just the constant term. But the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but earlier, when I multiplied each term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term was 120, which is 6 * 20. But that's just one part. So, if I'm to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement. \n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be \\(2(c + 1/c)\\), etc. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a polynomial, then it's 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if they want the coefficient as a number, perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut the problem didn't specify, so perhaps I should assume they want the coefficient as a number, so 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and is treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the expression. But that seems inconsistent with how polynomial multiplication works. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 6. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient as a number, then perhaps they mean the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 6, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems. In standard problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, you have to consider the coefficients from both parts. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient in the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, actually, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). That means, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I actually don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nNo, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term in the second expansion would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I only need the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nWait, so that means I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. I considered the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6, which is correct. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as 20, which seems right too. So, multiplying them together gives 120. That should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression because when you multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part only combines with the constant term from the second part to give \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 6 times 20 is 120. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), that's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter? Hmm, let me think. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how many times the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by terms from the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term, right? Because every term in its expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), either positive or negative. So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will have a factor of \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\) won't be a constant term, but in our case, we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so does that mean we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms? Or are we supposed to consider the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\) and find the coefficient of the specific monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms would have to cancel out to a constant term? Because if that's the case, then we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, that constant term multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would give us the coefficient we're looking for. So, let me check that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Then, find the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant (since we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms), we need the constant term from the second expansion. So, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply these together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I were to think about the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second part, gives \\(a^2b^2 * 20\\), so the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another way this could be approached. For example, could the problem be interpreted differently? Like, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if they were asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make much sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

That suggests that maybe the other part of the product, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just contribute a constant factor, right?

But wait, that doesn't seem right because if we multiply by all the terms in the second part, wouldn't each term contribute a different coefficient? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, we're looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and we want the sum of all coefficients of those terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the total coefficient. \n\nSo, let me try to compute that. The coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I find that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part, and \\(c\\) in the other, the terms don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). But let's expand it manually: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\) would both have coefficients 1, and similarly for the other terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), it's 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1 times 2, which is 2. That checks out. So, perhaps my approach is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the exponents on \\(c\\) might not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so their coefficients just add up. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and consider that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second.

So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times each coefficient from the second part. But since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum all these contributions. Hence, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm misapplying anything here. Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the exponents can interfere, but in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their exponents don't affect each other. So, the coefficients do indeed just multiply across the terms.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it would still be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something, but the coefficient would be multiplied by the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find all the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if we have a term like \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^m\\), that would be \\(c^{k - m}\\). So, to get a constant term, \\(k - m = 0\\), so \\(k = m\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(k = m = 3\\), because \\(6\\) is the exponent. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times c^{3 - 3} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider only the terms in the second expansion that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, which would be the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's why we only consider the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it would introduce factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself wouldn't get any coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then would the term not involve \\(c\\), so that \\(a^2b^2\\) remains as is without any \\(c\\) factors. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Wait, but does that make sense? Let me check. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and from the second part, I have a term that's \\(c^0\\), which is just a constant, then when I multiply them, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be that constant multiplied by 6, right? Alternatively, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but only when \\(k = 0\\) would the term not involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try that. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check. So, the first part contributes 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 for \\(c^0\\). When you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. But wait, another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's just a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it as a whole. So, the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the constant term in the second part is, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6*20=120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the product of two expressions. So, the first expression is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expression, and to get a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to multiply it by the constant term from the second expression, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 6*20=120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then any term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another approach: maybe I can treat the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and the second part contributes a constant factor. So, the coefficient is 6 times the constant term of the second part, which is 20, so 120. Yeah, that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me make sure that when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is indeed 20. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting the exponent to zero: 6 - 2m = 0 \u21d2 m=3. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6*20=120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, actually, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), I think I need to consider that the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when we multiply by the other polynomial, the \\(c\\) terms will just be multiplied by 1, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial, but actually, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a^2b^2. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6a^2b^2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each coefficient from the second polynomial is being multiplied by 6a^2b^2, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check this with another approach to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply by any other term from the second polynomial, which has positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), the result would have \\(c\\) terms, which are not present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, let me compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as calculated earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That makes more sense because it's only considering the constant term from the second polynomial, which doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I think my initial approach was wrong because I considered multiplying by all terms, but actually, only the constant term from the second polynomial will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product, since any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, so to clarify, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term in the product have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nLet me just double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). And in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I expand both polynomials and multiply them term by term. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial, as any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this part as well, but maybe I don't need to go through all the terms. Wait, since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it would have terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression, but perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, but \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the whole expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that is, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, I think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all terms, but that seems odd because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that can't be because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But let's check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, which would mean that the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so effectively, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because the \\(c\\) terms can cancel out. Wait, let me check that. Let's see, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, I think. So, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the problem just wants the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely. Wait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90/c^2 + 36/c^4 + 6/c^6. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered. So, let me go through that again step by step to make sure.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that would be if we were looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because each term in the product has both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only be multiplied by the constant terms (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in it, so when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, so perhaps the second part doesn't affect it. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second part is just a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the entire second expression. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Wait, so maybe the variables are \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part (6) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expression. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have 6 times something, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a certain power, but the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's just considering the coefficient as 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient from the first part, since the second part is multiplied by all terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expression. But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, to do that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That sounds more reasonable. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, the term becomes \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Does that mean I don't need to worry about the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply two expressions, the variables from one part don't affect the variables from the other part. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second part, say \\(c^k\\), then the overall term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need the term where the second part contributes a \\(c^0\\) term, meaning the constant term. \n\nSo, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).

In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Okay, so that's the first part done. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the next part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this as well, but wait, do I need to multiply it with the first part? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) might combine with the terms from the first expansion. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, I need to consider how it interacts with the second part. But actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would be multiplied by each term in that expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we are to consider the entire coefficient, including contributions from the second part? Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both separately, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and terms involving various powers of \\(c\\) from the second part. When multiplied together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a term in the entire expression unless it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would only be possible if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant), which is just a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because that would be the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Let me confirm that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which, when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the central term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because in the expansion of \\((x + y)^n\\), the coefficient of \\(x^{n - k}y^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\). So, in this case, \\(x = c\\) and \\(y = 1/c\\), so each term is \\(c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in the term \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 20. Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is indeed 20. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then we would have to consider other terms, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the constant term from the second part that contributes. So, I think that's correct. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, wait, wait, hold on! I think I made a mistake here. Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. Wait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 20, but now I'm thinking it's 120. Let me clarify this again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you get terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), but that's not quite right. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) for all m. But wait, that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, we need to find the term in the second expansion where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. When you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) with coefficient 20, the product will have a term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. So, I think my initial thought was wrong when I thought it was 20. It's actually 120 because you have to multiply the coefficients from both parts. So, the correct coefficient is 120. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions and consider how the terms combine. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15(1/c^2), 6(1/c^4), 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15(1/c^2)\\), \\(6(1/c^4)\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all these coefficients multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, when the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. I think I confused myself earlier by considering all terms, but the problem specifically asks for \\(a^2b^2\\), which only occurs when the second part contributes a constant term. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Similarly, using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.

So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of the second part as well, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? So, when I multiply the two expressions together, I'm looking for the term that comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and any term from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Hmm, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but the entire product would have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the term from the first expansion multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, because the second expansion can contribute a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial, provided that the exponents add up correctly. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, each term from the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and wants the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense, because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out, leaving a constant term. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. Hmm, maybe it's considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so the constant term. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, perhaps I should interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. So, let's proceed with that assumption. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. So, yes, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me confirm this. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion with coefficient 20. When you multiply these together, you get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) with coefficient 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that should be the answer. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, it's more likely that it's asking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, correct. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives the constant term when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1.
