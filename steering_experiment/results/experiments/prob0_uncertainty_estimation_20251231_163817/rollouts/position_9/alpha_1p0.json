    "text": " Let me think: in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms involving powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but none involving \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, it's just 6 times the sum of all terms from the second part. Wait, no, that might not be right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part evaluated at a specific term? No, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that's not correct either because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has multiple terms, and each term would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a separate expression, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the coefficient is just 6, because the second expansion is multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second factor. Because each term in the second factor will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total contribution to the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first factor times the sum of the coefficients from the second factor. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is considering the entire product, so I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficients. Wait, but actually, no. Let me think carefully. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're looking for all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient. So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be interpreted differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering the entire product, but perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by the second part, you're effectively scaling the entire first expansion by the second expansion. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   This expansion will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to account for all terms in this expansion when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   To find the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Setting \\(c = 1\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then that's multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter because we're only looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's going to be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? But that seems a bit off because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless we're looking for terms that cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, but the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire second expansion? But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the \\(c\\) terms are... well, they don't specify, so maybe the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions. So, each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so if we're considering the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems incorrect because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just being multiplied as a whole, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the second part is, but that seems unclear. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then this is multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for some \\(m\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes both parts. Wait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by this, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6. But I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by all terms in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems incorrect because the entire product would have each term from the first expansion multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Let me check that again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer. But to be sure, let me think of it another way. When you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it must be the case that we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But wait, that seems correct because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which has 64 as the sum of coefficients, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the entire Q(c). But since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in c. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any c's. Wait, that can't be, because when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c's would be zero unless k=0. Wait, but that's not the case here.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply those two coefficients together.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term.\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so that's the answer? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, we have \\(c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 384, but that was when I was considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. But now I realize that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so we need to find the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, and multiply by 6, giving 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That gives us 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients together:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I want \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, substituting \\(k = 2\\), the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does that mean I need to consider the entire expression, including the second part? Or is it just the coefficient from the first part? Hmm, maybe I need to think about how these two parts interact. Wait, the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\). But no, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just considering the part that comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial's terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which is a different variable. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. Hmm, but the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in a different variable. Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes the terms from both polynomials. So, each term in the product is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second polynomial. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I need to find all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not possible because the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, meaning the constant term. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems a bit more involved. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, so that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial. That might make sense. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it's possible that it's considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term, they mean in the entire expansion, considering all variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Hmm, perhaps that's the case. Let me try to proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, then multiply them together.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which equals 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not necessarily multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well. So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial, which is \\(c^0\\). That would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's in a different variable. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do interact.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (6a^2b^2) \\times \\left(\\text{something in }c\\right) \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\text{something in }c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in one polynomial get multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficients 6 times the respective coefficients from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let's calculate that.\n\nSo, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and it's multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems odd because the problem includes both parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but only for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that's the most plausible interpretation. So, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm still misinterpreting it. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical value. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term of the second polynomial, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is part of the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is not a single number but a polynomial. Since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's expecting a polynomial, but that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable interpretation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me check my calculations again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct.\n\nNext, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the contributions from both parts of the product.

Multiplying these together gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me set \\(4 - k = 2\\) because \\(a\\) is raised to \\(4 - k\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by every term in that expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but no, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all the possible terms from both expansions that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, when the term is a constant with respect to \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That would make sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because when I multiply by \\(c^0\\), the term remains as a constant, so the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Let me think. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me confirm that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me see, when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just one part, and then it's multiplied by the expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me think about that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these are being multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here.

Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I might just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then consider whether the second part affects it.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times something, but that something is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible coefficients regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you might be looking for a numerical coefficient, assuming all other variables are treated as constants. Wait, but in this case, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering that the coefficient can include terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit strange. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a constant. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand both parts separately, the first part has terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second part has terms like \\(c^6, c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} = c^4\\), and so on, down to \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient isn't just a number; it's an expression involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be expressed as such, but that seems a bit unusual. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a product of two independent expressions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part, as the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, and the rest would be part of the coefficient involving \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, but since \\(c\\) is a variable, that might not be possible. Wait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps that's the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, but that's not specified. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is separate, but I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to do that, I can consider that each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, but that would be incorrect because the coefficients in the second polynomial are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so they don't sum up in that way. Wait, no, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial would be obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve setting the exponents of \\(c\\) to zero. But that's not specified in the problem. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be a polynomial in \\(c\\), so perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, maybe it's a trick question, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the answer is simply 6, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's the coefficient. Therefore, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the coefficient as 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, but that would be 6 times 2^6, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all \\(c\\) terms are combined, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the first approach. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I can think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. So, to write it out, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if I were to expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I could express it as a sum, but I think the problem is expecting the answer in terms of binomial coefficients, so perhaps I can write it as \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). But that might be more detailed than necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, so the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second part. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the term involving \\(c\\), but I don't think that's the case because when you multiply polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, I think the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, for example, if you have \\( (a + b) \\times (c + d) \\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would involve finding the term in the second polynomial where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific power of \\(c\\). Therefore, I think the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate, but I don't think that's correct because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply as well. So, I think the correct answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 times the second polynomial. Therefore, the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6, and the second part is just another polynomial, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients combine. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 times \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the entire second polynomial. Therefore, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, yes, that's 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire second factor. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nHowever, if the problem is seeking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the answer remains \\(6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If instead, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we would find the constant term in the second factor, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and multiply it by 6, resulting in 120. But since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), the most accurate answer is:\n\n\\boxed{6\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the terms in the second expression that are constants, but wait, actually, no, because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but not constants unless we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part, regardless of what it is, will just add more factors. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum up their coefficients, because each of those terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in the second expansion are not constants; they are coefficients multiplied by powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, what's the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term in the second expansion. Because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the power of \\(c\\), and the problem didn't specify. Hmm, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nWait, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, if we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient would be 6*64=384. But that seems like the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). However, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6*(sum of coefficients in second expansion) = 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, 6*64=384. But I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k=3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6*20=120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But that seems a bit strange because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you consider all possible ways to get that term, which in this case would involve multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by every term in the second expansion, leading to the coefficient being 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the constant term, it would be 120. \n\nWait, but looking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges based on the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4? Wait, no, because in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first expansion only goes up to \\(a^2b^0\\) and \\(a^0b^2\\). Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present unless multiplied by something else. Hmm, maybe my earlier reasoning is flawed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, which would be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part in the product. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will contribute to a different power of \\(c\\). So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6*20=120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two expressions, \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the product \\(A \\cdot B\\) will have terms that are products of terms from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64=384. \n\nBut wait, in reality, each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would indeed be the sum of all those contributions, which is 6*64=384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6*20=120. But since it didn't specify, I think the answer is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has 64 terms when considering all coefficients, so multiplying them would give 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(B\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which includes all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), which is 6*64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in \\(B\\) is found by setting \\(c=1\\), so \\(B\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\cdot B\\) is 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me check: when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I think the coefficient won't be affected by the other part of the product, right? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of terms in one part don't affect the coefficients of terms in the other part unless they share variables. In this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) only has \\(c\\). So, when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, the variables are independent, so any term in one doesn't affect the terms in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as in the first polynomial, because when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, it's like scaling each term by all possible terms in the second polynomial, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the scaling factor is just 1, because the second polynomial's terms don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, no, that might not be the case. Let me try to see with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\). When I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) remains as \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which should only involve the coefficients from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second factor. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor, because the second factor doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second factor, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but those are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where the second factor contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. 2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720/(6*6) is 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, so the final coefficient is 120? Hmm, let me check that again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that specific term. In this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider both expansions together. Hmm, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the term that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times 1, since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that seems too simple. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is that when you multiply out the entire expression, you might get terms that combine \\(a^2b^2\\) with some terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it would be part of the product is if it's multiplied by 1, but the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term (i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\)). Wait, does it? Let me check. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are even numbers from 6 down to -6. So, the only way to get a term that's just a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me go through it again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with exponents of \\(c\\) as I calculated before, and the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is 20. So, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case when it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. But wait, let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient from the second part is just 1 when \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Hmm, so does that mean that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they are separate variables. Let me think about this. The expression is a product of two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, when you multiply them together, the terms won't interfere with each other.

But wait, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're adding different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the original coefficient times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A + B + C + D\\), where each term is \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = E + F + G + ...\\), where each term is a power of \\(c\\). Then, when I multiply them together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2E\\), \\(a^2b^2F\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of those coefficients. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to compute 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought earlier. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check if I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. The problem says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which could have various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of any term in the second part is some value, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). And \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, because in the expansion, each term is multiplied by 1 and 1 (from c and 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 2. So, that seems to support my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the variables are different. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. \n\nLet me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only in \\((a + b)^4\\). When you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(1/c\\) gives \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself remains 6 because the other terms involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it doesn't change the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\); it just adds more variables. So, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it another way. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\). Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is some expression in terms of \\(c\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), giving terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but none of these affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because they all have additional \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply 6a^2b^2 by the constant term, that would give me a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas multiplying by other terms would add \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that makes sense because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., the constant term. \n\nSo, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, so I think I was wrong earlier. I thought it was just 6, but actually, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to consider the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nLet me verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20 when expanded. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms}\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in them, so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 6, but now I'm getting 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), etc., down to the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all these products. But wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate, so when you multiply, each term is a product of terms from each part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) in them, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a single expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Because any other term in the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is 20) do we get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as two separate parts: the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part involving \\(c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.

The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also have to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or maybe I do? Let me think. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when I multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, because each term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will have 6 as the coefficient, multiplied by some coefficient from the \\(c\\) terms? Or is it more complicated?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, when we multiply the two polynomials together, any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But wait, no, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) times any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when we multiply it by each term in the second polynomial, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) would be the only ones that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, let's try that approach. First, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6a^2b^2, and then multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I was considering all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the second polynomial would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 * 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as a product of two separate expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but only if the parts are independent. Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, so the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if we take the constant term from the second part. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider that as well. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but actually, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms from the second expansion will be multiplied by the terms from the first. So, maybe I need to consider how the terms combine. Wait, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when I expand both, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that only the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it will become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply it by the constant term in the second expansion, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nSo, now, going back to the original problem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion has a coefficient of 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 * 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply them, the \\(c\\) terms disappear, leaving me with \\(a^2b^2\\) and the coefficient 120. So, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term where the second expansion contributes a constant term. So, that's why I needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, giving 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I get terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, that would give \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. \n\nWait, but is that the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or could there be other terms where \\(c\\) cancels out? Let me think: For example, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by \\(c^k\\) and \\(1/c^k\\), but that would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is still \\(a^2b^2\\), but only if the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Wait, but in the second expansion, each term is either a positive power of \\(c\\) or a negative power. So, unless I take the term where the exponent is zero, which is the constant term, all other terms would result in \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), then I can think of the expression as the product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's exactly what I did before. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get it is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. If I were to write out \\((a + b)^4\\) as \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\), then when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the term \\(20\\) in the second expansion is a constant, so \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\) would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute? For example, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by \\(c^k\\), would that ever result in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? No, because \\(c^k\\) is not 1 unless \\(k=0\\). So, only the constant term contributes. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) again. Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when is 6 - 2m = 0? That's when m = 3, as I found earlier. So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possibilities. Suppose I made a mistake in the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\n\\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 6, which is correct. \n\n\\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (720)/(6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20, which is correct. \n\nSo, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the exponents add up. Wait, let me explain that again. If I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I'm multiplying by something from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term from the second expansion.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the second expansion only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is also being expanded. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second, leading to cross terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which would be 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean that for each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by that term, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at it another way. Let me consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so it's just a constant. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Let me think. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which is when you set \\(c = 1\\), but that gives the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. But actually, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the correct answer. Let me just verify this again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (20) from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we determine that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me think. In the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't affect this coefficient? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. So, the entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum \\text{terms}\\), then the product will have terms that are products of each term from the first sum and each term from the second sum. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think that when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve any combination where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and when multiplied by the other expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just one term, and when you multiply it by each term in the other expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right either. Because in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. The sum of its coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but only the ones where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me confirm this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I thought earlier. Then, multiplying by the coefficient from the first part, 6, gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's the former, 384. Wait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first expression, then in the product, it's multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to make sure, let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part. The coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. But looking at the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, which sum to 2. So, yes, that works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2. So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me see. When \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the entire expression, which is the product of two binomials. So, the coefficient I found, 6, is part of the expansion of the first binomial. But when I multiply this by the second binomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, does that mean that the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there something else I need to consider?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But that seems a bit off because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a single polynomial, and they want the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in that expansion. But then, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the context of the entire expression, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms.

So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the other terms involve \\(c\\), but we're only focusing on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems wrong because the coefficient can't be a function of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

When you multiply these two, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product.

So, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which would still be a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would still require knowing the power of \\(c\\), which isn't specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of the second part, but that's not a single number. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so that's 64. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients. So, if I multiply this by 6, I get 384, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by considering a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is \\(c + 1/c\\) times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of the coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 2. So, applying that logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we calculate the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying this by 6 gives the final coefficient.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't influence that term. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but we're considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, each term contributes a factor, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me find the sum of the coefficients in that expansion. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by each term in the second part, each term in the second part is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms? Or is the problem only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable? Wait, the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering all terms where the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), but it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), but in the product, every term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as if you multiplied the two expansions, and you're just looking for the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). But in that case, each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a factor when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Let me check that again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would be 6 * 6, and so on. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, then that would be 6 times the constant term from the second part. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. So, in the expansion, the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3(1/c)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is the sum over all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to clarify which interpretation is correct. In problems like this, usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, they are considering the term where all specified variables have the given exponents, and the other variables can be anything. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is another variable, and the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's possible that it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only considering terms where \\(c\\) is present to the zero power, then it's 120. Hmm, I think I need to check which interpretation is correct. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that \\(c\\) terms are also involved, but that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. Wait, no, in the product, every term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether it's looking for the coefficient when multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms or only when \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power. But since the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), perhaps it's expecting the sum of all coefficients where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which isn't a single number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but earlier I thought that if we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. So, maybe I should check both possibilities. Let me calculate both. First, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Second, the constant term in the second part is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Now, which one is correct? I think it depends on the problem's wording. Since it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\), it's more likely that it's expecting the sum over all \\(c\\) terms, so 384. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term on its own, regardless of \\(c\\), but in the product, every term has some power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both parts separately and then multiply them, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give the desired term. So, in this case, the desired term is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with a positive or negative power of \\(c\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120. I think I was confused earlier because I considered the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, you need to multiply by the constant term from the second part. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the expansion of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):** Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):** The constant term occurs when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) balance out, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, so does the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression depend on the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\)?\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the variables are separate. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but considering all the terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of the expansion multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning it's just the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the question is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.

That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) add up to zero. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expansion.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So, let me approach it that way. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which requires \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, I also need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). Setting that equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that gives \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), because \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the product of the two expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second expansion. So, the coefficient is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nSo, I think I've got it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficients from each part of the product that contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\n1.

    "text": " Let me check when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That would mean \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when we multiply the two expressions, the terms will combine. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\\). So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient. \n\nWait a second, but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part because \\(c^0\\) is the only term that doesn't affect the power of \\(c\\). So, I think my reasoning is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), which is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, yeah, I think that's right. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap. I used the binomial theorem on both parts, found the required coefficients, multiplied them together, and got 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
