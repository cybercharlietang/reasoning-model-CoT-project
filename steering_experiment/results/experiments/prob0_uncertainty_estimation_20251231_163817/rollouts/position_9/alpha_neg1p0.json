    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so for \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a factor that is added to the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, say, \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire expression \\(Q(c)\\), because \\(Q(c)\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient in the entire expression, treating all variables as separate. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is considering all variables together, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you take any other term from the second expansion, it would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term in the product involve \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, we found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as expanding both parts separately and then multiplying the specific terms. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(20c^0\\), so when you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 * 20 * a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\). So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the expansion of both parts and find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't matter because the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I might have misread. Let me check the problem again: it says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the rest can be any term from the other part. So, perhaps I need to multiply the coefficients from both expansions. But wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the entire second part can be anything because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part might have coefficients that affect the overall coefficient. Wait, no, because in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is probably asking for the coefficient when considering both parts. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are just part of the expression, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But actually, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that any term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 1. So, that would mean that we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, let's approach it that way.\n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since we're multiplying the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), as I did earlier, which gives 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical value.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, it's probably expecting a numerical value, so perhaps I'm supposed to find the constant term in the second expansion, as I did earlier, and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, to recap: From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives the term \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are even numbers from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2. The term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in 120 as the coefficient. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6, resulting in 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the first polynomial only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving some variables, it's implied that the other variables are to be treated as constants or that we're looking for the term where those variables have specific exponents, and the other variables can be anything. But in this case, since the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient when considering that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but the coefficient is only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, and that would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, resulting in 120.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a numerical value. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, after going through all these steps and double-checking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the final coefficient of 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\), so the term is when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to figure out how this multiplication affects the coefficient we're looking for. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so maybe those terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term directly? Or do they? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself is just a constant with respect to \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the other terms don't involve \\(c\\), but that's not possible unless \\(k = 0\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the expression includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but that would include all the terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem specifically mentions the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, but that would mean that the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would include terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, right? Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too straightforward, and I'm not sure if that's correct because maybe the problem is only considering the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), perhaps the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is when the second factor contributes a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you still have \\(a^2b^2\\). Otherwise, if the second factor contributes a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which would not be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and then multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. So, let me try that approach.\n\nSo, first, find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term when \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20, you get \\(20a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just double-check my reasoning. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which is when \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{n}\\), where \\(n\\) is some exponent. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, the only contributing term is when \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion and \\(m = 3\\) in the second expansion, giving the coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe are interested in the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) when \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not sure if it's considering the entire expression or just the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, including the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the given expression. So, perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms would be part of other terms in the expansion. Wait, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384, which seems high. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to break it down differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion has \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 2^6 = 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term in the expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, it would create multiple terms. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean that it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would just be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term will have \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), where \\(k + m = 4\\) and \\(n\\) is determined by the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. So, that would mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and summing their coefficients. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is only one term, and the coefficient is 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the two expansions:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first expansion (6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\n4. **Calculate the sum of coefficients in the second expansion:**\n   The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compute the final coefficient:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, actually, since the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part times 1? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't affect it, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, maybe I misread the problem. It's not asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something; it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of which is a term involving \\(c\\) raised to some power. But when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum of all those products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Wait, no, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (if any) in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If there's no constant term, then the coefficient would be zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that's not the case because only the constant term would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, it's 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Therefore, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part? Let me think about it. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a,b) and Q(c). Then, P(a,b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a,b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, so it's 6 * [sum of coefficients in Q(c)], which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Then, I realized that this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible c terms is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting c=1, which gives 2^6=64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. This coefficient is then multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would happen when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for that term in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, after expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) as one of the terms. But then this term is multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), because any other term would involve different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied by the other part. So, I can focus solely on the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term and see how it interacts with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term is just one term in the product, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will produce terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we're looking for all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're considering the entire product. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remains 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is present in all those products. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has its own coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), those coefficients just add up. So, yes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to be more precise, I could expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and then sum all the coefficients. Let's try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and an exponent of \\(c\\) as \\(6 - 2k\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to interpret the problem? Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and maybe the problem is only interested in the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. That would make sense too. Let me check the original problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, my initial approach is correct, and the answer is 384. \n\nBut to be thorough, let me consider both interpretations. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we would need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would have to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's see. From the expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nBut the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part, so I think the first interpretation is correct, and the answer is 384. However, to make sure, let me check the wording again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficients of terms in the product are found by multiplying the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial has a coefficient of 6, and the entire second polynomial has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all possible \\(k\\). So, yes, 384 is the correct answer. \n\nI think I've thought this through enough. The key steps are:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Recognize that this term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n3. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n\n4. Multiply 6 by 64 to get 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That means I'm looking for the term where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, in the expansion, that term occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which implies that \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that part of the expression doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), because it's only dealing with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part will affect the overall term when multiplied, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6 times whatever comes from the other part. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that's only from the first part. So, when we multiply by the second part, each term from the first part gets multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion, but that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power. Wait, but no, that's not correct either because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times 64? That would be 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^m c^n\\) and so on. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes a coefficient to the product. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but only looking at the \\(a^2b^2\\) part, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second expansion could have terms that cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, but I don't think that's the case here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as the product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), and then multiply that by 6. So, let's see. The term with \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we have to consider the entire expansion, and find the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would still be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients from the second expansion. So, I think 384 is the answer. Wait, but let me confirm. Let me think about how polynomial multiplication works. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the entire Q(c), because every term in Q(c) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). The sum of all coefficients in Q(c) is Q(1) = \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the answer would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. So, I think the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and it gets multiplied by every term from the second part, but since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression evaluated as a polynomial. But wait, that's not the right way to think about it. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\( (6a^2b^2) \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. I think I'm confusing myself here. Let me try to approach this differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second part, effectively scaling its coefficient by the entire second expression. Wait, but that's not the case because each term in the product is a separate term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. I think I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me clarify: When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that specific term. In this case, the specific term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we calculated. In the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when we multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the product should be a single expression, not a polynomial multiplied by another polynomial. Wait, no, actually, the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a product of two separate polynomials. Therefore, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which implies that we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients. Let me think differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), then yes, every term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\) or something, then we would have to calculate the specific coefficient in the second polynomial and multiply by 6. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not sure if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the other part doesn't matter because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, but let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it's affected by the second part. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient from the second part is just 1 because it's not affecting the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it might have its own coefficients. Wait, no, because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, the \\(c\\) terms can be anything because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 1, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first part gets multiplied by every term from the second part, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms can be any combination, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not correct either because the second part isn't just being added; it's being multiplied as a whole. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only term in the product that will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term where we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and any term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that's not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part because the other part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and not in the second, the second polynomial contributes a factor that is the entire sum of its coefficients. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, that would give 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6, c^5, c^4, c^3, c^2, c, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^3, 1/c^4, 1/c^5, 1/c^6\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^5, \\dots, a^2b^2\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part because each time \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term from the second part, the coefficient gets added. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, maybe the multiplication by the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the first part only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms from the first part don't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients from the first part and the second part multiply together. But wait, actually, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) in the second part, because only then will the term not involve \\(c\\), and thus the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But we only want the terms in the second part that contribute to \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms, which we don't want when considering \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part, since that's the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part gives 6, and the second part gives 20, so the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is correct. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, but actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean we're summing over all terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, which is exactly the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the other polynomial that don't affect the variables we're considering. Since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms must be such that they don't contribute any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which is the \\(c^0\\) term, so yes, 20. Therefore, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial.

That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right.\n\nSo, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, for the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. To find the constant term in the expansion, we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were considering all coefficients in the second part, which would be 64. But now, considering that we need the constant term, it's 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\), then in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), with each term corresponding to a different power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That makes more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, then multiply them together to get 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let's consider the entire product: \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 20, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) would be 15, and so on. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in the context of such problems, usually, they're asking for the coefficient of the term where the exponents of all variables are specified, including \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Multiply them: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, which would make the coefficient 6*64=384, but that's if we're considering all coefficients, which doesn't make sense for the problem as stated. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But if we're only interested in the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\), then we need to take 6*20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second polynomial, which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\), so in the binomial expansion, that's when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) because the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term with \\(c\\). Wait, actually, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? That seems high, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in that expansion contributes to a term in the final product, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion's coefficients, meaning 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but the product is a polynomial in a, b, c, 1/c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting c=1, which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe the answer is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the terms where the exponents of c cancel out, but the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the c terms, so that would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and when you multiply these two, the terms involving a and b are separate from those involving c. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is when c=1, giving 6*(2^6) = 6*64=384. So, yes, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, which has terms in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients is when c=1, which is (1 + 1)^6=64, so 6*64=384. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider that, maybe I could think of the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. I think that's correct.\n\nSo, after going through this, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since this term is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term. So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), that would give me the term I want. So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute a constant factor or maybe something else. Wait, actually, since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant term, meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that any terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is only concerned with \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because the second part could have multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would each contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe I need to consider all possible terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the term becomes \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. Then, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times that constant term. \n\nLet me check that logic again. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Similarly, when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4 \\times (1/c)^1\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, and then I multiply it by each term from the second expansion, the result would be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 15\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^{-2}\\), and \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in this case, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 20 times 6, which is 120. \n\nHmm, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through it again. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with exponents \\(6 - 2k\\). The constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. \n\nI think that's the answer. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).

The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combining the results:**  \n   Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, no, I think it's specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are separate variables. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're only considering the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero? Because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't affected by \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would mean that we're looking for all terms in the expansion where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of terms from each bracket. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then from the second part, I have terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from each part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part, so 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems off because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first bracket, and it's multiplied by every term in the second bracket. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first bracket times the sum of all coefficients from the second bracket, because each term in the second bracket contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second bracket is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first bracket) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second bracket), giving 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that \\(c\\) terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\) and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various \\(c\\) exponents, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second bracket, because each term in the second bracket multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second bracket, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). But if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's \\(c + 1/c\\). But in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's similar to the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this smaller example. So, in that case, the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients in the second bracket. So, applying that to our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first bracket times the sum of the coefficients from the second bracket. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But that might not be the case. The problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the term without any \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, that would require finding the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and then multiplying that by the coefficient from the first bracket. So, let's try that approach. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, the constant term. So, let's find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product has a coefficient of 6 (from the first bracket) multiplied by 20 (from the second bracket), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second bracket, which would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times all powers of \\(c\\). But if the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second bracket, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), and the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6-2k}\\).

So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean it's considering the entire expression, so \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it, but doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but each of those terms would have different powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is an expression in \\(c\\), so perhaps the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one part, but the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, that can't be right because the coefficient is specific to \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the second part is a separate variable. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it's not a single coefficient, but rather a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, but that seems unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That might make sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k=3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" If we're considering the entire product, then \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the product, but it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, unless we're looking for a specific term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) and some combination of \\(c\\), the coefficient might just be 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check this again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving us 6 * 20 = 120 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second part multiplied by 6.

Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me assume that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, to find that, I need to consider both parts: the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), needs to give a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

    "text": " That means I need the term where \\(a^{2}\\) and \\(b^{2}\\). So, in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then we have to multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we just need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we need to find the coefficient of the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), right? So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion, you need the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the product term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, leaving just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two parts, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the expansion that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would have to be multiplied by a term that cancels out the \\(c\\) to get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the only contribution is from the term where \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(c^0\\), and the coefficient is 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion because when \\(k = 2\\), the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Let me think. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) will just multiply the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) can be any term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and multiply them by all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, does that mean I just need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, and sum all those products? Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expression, so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that might not be correct because each term in the product would be the product of a term from the first expression and a term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would contribute to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, no. The entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then the product is \\(P \\times Q\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P \\times Q\\) is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each coefficient from \\(Q\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the coefficient from \\(P\\) times the sum of coefficients from \\(Q\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions. So, if I have \\(P = \\sum p_i\\) and \\(Q = \\sum q_j\\), then \\(P \\times Q = \\sum p_i q_j\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is a specific term, say \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(each term in Q)}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only consider the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present. Wait, but in the product \\(P \\times Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(P\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - k}\\), depending on the term in \\(Q\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be separate terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but let me verify this. Suppose I have \\(P = (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand \\(Q\\) using the binomial theorem as well. \\(Q = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when I multiply \\(P\\) by \\(Q\\), each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product has specific exponents for \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem includes both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for some \\(m\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part would contribute a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0\\) would be the constant term, and that way, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term wouldn't be multiplied by any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), just 1. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me see. If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. \n\nWait, but that makes more sense. Because if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider only the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are 0, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Because if I set \\(c = 1\\), the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64, but that would give me the total contribution of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(c^0\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part and multiply them together. \n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from ac and a/c), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be zero because there's no term with \\(a\\) and \\(c^0\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 0 = 0, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\), because \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Which is correct because the expansion would include \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2 + ...\\) etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) (with \\(c^0\\)) is indeed 2. \n\nSo, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But that seems incorrect because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, which would require \\(c^0\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each possible power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for all terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm confused now because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me clarify the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term in the product where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, and \\(c\\) can have any exponent. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(k\\), would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too high. Let me test this with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from ac and a/c), and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\) is 0 because there's no term with \\(c^0\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in this product, it would be 2 (from ac and a/c), which is 1 (coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in \\((a + b)^1\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)), which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. \n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 3 (since \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\), sum of coefficients is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4? Wait, no, actually, when \\(c = 1\\), \\((1 + 1)^2 = 4\\), so the sum of coefficients is 4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 4 = 4. Let me check the expansion: \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^2 = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\). The term \\(a^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion gives \\(a^2c^2 + 2a^2 + a^2/c^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 1 (from \\(a^2c^2\\)) + 2 (from \\(2a^2\\)) + 1 (from \\(a^2/c^2\\)) = 4, which matches 1 * 4. \n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the \\(c^0\\) term. So, which is correct? Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. When we talk about the coefficient of a term in a product, it's the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can be formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) with any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, resulting in 384. \n\nHowever, I'm now confused because earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would require \\(c^0\\), but that's only if we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But the problem doesn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\)'s exponent. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider all possible terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2, and \\(c\\) can have any exponent. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a specific example. Let's take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 (from ac) + 1 (from a/c) = 2. So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2), giving 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after this lengthy consideration, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which gave me 120. But now, I'm convinced that the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, giving 384. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, I'm now second-guessing because sometimes in problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), they might be considering the term without any other variables, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, to resolve this, perhaps I should look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (c^0) from the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut then, in my earlier example, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2, which is 1 * 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second part. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^0\\), it would be 0, because there's no such term. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, perhaps I should clarify: in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would have been 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nGiven that the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Let me compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nSince the problem didn't specify any exponent for \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in typical problems, when they ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they usually mean the term where those variables are present with the specified exponents and the other variables are absent or at zero exponent. So, in this case, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nBut I'm now confused because different interpretations lead to different answers. To clarify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each, and \\(c\\) can have any exponent. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". In the product, each term has specific exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be present if \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, because otherwise, the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nWait, but in standard terminology, when you're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product that includes other variables, it's often interpreted as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) must also be raised to the 0 power. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTo resolve this, perhaps I should consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only appear when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and is asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 384. \n\nGiven that the problem statement doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is that \\(c\\) is another variable, and the problem is asking for the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that \\(c\\) must also be raised to the 0 power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), that would be unambiguous. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's unclear. However, in many algebra problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include other variables, it's often assumed that those variables are at zero exponent. Therefore, the coefficient would be 120. \n\nBut to make sure, let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the product is a combination of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by a term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), i.e., a constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second polynomial that isn't a constant, you would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second polynomial, which is \\(c"

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. In the expansion, each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider how this part interacts with the first part. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. But since the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all in terms of \\(c\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific power of \\(c\\), does that mean we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or is there a specific power of \\(c\\) we're supposed to consider? Wait, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, as calculated earlier. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would be the middle term. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. That would make sense because then the entire term would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me check that. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but I think it's implied that we're looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of a larger term. So, I think my reasoning makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. The product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"
