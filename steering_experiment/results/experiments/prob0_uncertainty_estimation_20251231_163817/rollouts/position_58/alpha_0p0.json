    "text": " I don't think I made any mistakes here. It all adds up.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the term where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. So, yes, that's correct.
