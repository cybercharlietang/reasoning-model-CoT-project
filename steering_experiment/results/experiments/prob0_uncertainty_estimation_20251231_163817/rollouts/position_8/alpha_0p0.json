    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will just be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when we multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part. However, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term itself doesn't change. Wait, no, that's not right. The \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a single term, so when you multiply it by each term in the second part, you'll get multiple terms, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second part. But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so none of those terms have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But that doesn't seem right either because the second part is a separate expression. Let me think again. When you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But since the first factor has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second factor has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms in the product will have combinations like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first factor multiplied by each term in the second factor. But since the second factor doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second factor. Wait, but the second factor is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the sum of its coefficients. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because I think I might be overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, it has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by each coefficient in the second part, but since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), we need to consider how the multiplication affects it. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient in the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second part that are constants, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because only those terms will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, let me check: in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the middle term. The expansion is symmetric, so the middle term when the exponent is zero is when we have equal numbers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me compute that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the constant term in the second part (20), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought the sum of coefficients was 64, but that would be if I set \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients. But since I only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, as I found. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term (20) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because multiplying by any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I'm supposed to multiply each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by each term in the first. But since I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the term where we took \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then any term from the second part. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we expand it, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), right? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that can't be, because \\(c\\) is part of the expression. So maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, and then added together. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, no, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, but in the product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, it's just 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was under the assumption that the problem was asking for the sum of all coefficients, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term. So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (with coefficient 6) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when we take the coefficient 6 and multiply it by each of these terms, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear as \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2\\) (from the constant term in the second expansion). All other terms will have powers of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. Let me just check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. Then, for the second expansion, we set the exponent to zero, which occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c, 1/c\\) are separate, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from the corresponding term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as a sum of terms like \\(6a^2b^2\\) and other terms, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is if the term from the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will only combine with the constant term from the second polynomial to give a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Any other terms from the second polynomial would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, I need to calculate two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, I can multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, first, let me confirm the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, as I did before, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is indeed 6. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand this. Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let me compute the coefficient for that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, when we multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (which comes from the first part) multiplied by the constant term (from the second part) will give us the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct. \n\nLet me just recap to ensure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are separate, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, I correctly found the coefficients of each and multiplied them together. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power, which would have multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all terms in the second part that don't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponent is zero, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponents cancel out is when you choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times c^{0}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term. So when you multiply them, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Or maybe I need to consider the entire expression and how the terms interact? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it will still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), whereas if we multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it will introduce \\(c\\) into the term, which we don't want. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, by the constant term from the second part, which is 20.

Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the multiplication by the second expression will just scale the coefficient by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part.\n\nSo, I've already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate polynomials, each with their own variables. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial.

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and multiplying by that won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is 6, and it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we need to see how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. Wait, but actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find how much it's multiplied by. But wait, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a standalone term, and when multiplied by the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second expansion, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, no, the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms; it only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by the entire second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(a^2b^2c^0 = a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), because that's where the exponent is zero, which is \\(c^0\\). So, solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20, yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible powers of \\(c\\), but wait, no, in the problem statement, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that's why we needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiplied by 6 from the first part. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that's not correct because when you multiply, the exponents add. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because that's the only way you get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that's why we needed the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiplied by 6, giving 120. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is just the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems consistent.\n\nLet me check my calculations again. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. For the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems right.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think about the entire expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

    "text": " So, in this expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should think about the entire expression as a product of two expansions. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've expanded, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I can expand the second part as well using the binomial theorem. Let me do that: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be the product of the two sums. So, it's like \\(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). \n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I only need to consider the terms in the first sum where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and then multiply by the entire second sum because the second sum involves \\(c\\) terms, which don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, that might be the case. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply by any term in the second part, say \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, because when you multiply by the second expansion, you're adding more terms, but each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, let me check that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, but that seems high. Wait, let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I can treat the second factor as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{...}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a single expression, and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this another way. Let's compute the product step by step. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n- The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\):\n- This expansion will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2, each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients.\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) equal to 64? Let me check by expanding it. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So yes, the sum is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the coefficient would only involve the specific term, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem didn't specify. Wait, no, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check what the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is. \n\nIn the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 384, considering all powers of \\(c\\). But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when problems ask for the coefficient of a term without specifying other variables, they might be considering the term independent of those other variables. \n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's fixed. Then, for each \\(m\\), we have different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, maybe that's not the case. Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which could be part of multiple terms in the product, each with different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me see if I can find a definitive approach. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to treating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a constant and just taking the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. But that can't be right because the second part is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in one part and \\(c\\) in another, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all variables. So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut since the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a term in P(a, b) is unaffected by Q(c) because they are separate variables. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from P(a, b), which is 6, multiplied by the entire Q(c). But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nBut I'm still unsure. Let me try to compute the product more carefully. \n\nThe product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me denote \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWhen I multiply P(a, b) and Q(c), I get a new polynomial where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) will be multiplied by each term in Q(c), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nSince the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts multiplied together. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", so the entire expression. \n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo and meant to ask for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but without that, I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me see if that makes sense. If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 * 64 = 1024\\). On the other hand, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and sum the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\), that would be 384. But 384 is less than 1024, so that seems possible. \n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), and \\(c = 1\\), the sum of all coefficients in the product is 16 * 64 = 1024. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, so that seems reasonable. \n\nWait, but let me check: the sum of all coefficients in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 16, and the sum in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total sum is 16 * 64 = 1024, which matches. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by 64, gives 384. So, that seems consistent. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another angle. Suppose I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the variables are separate, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because it's a product of sums, not a product of coefficients. \n\nWait, no, actually, when you have two separate variables, the coefficient of a term in one variable is independent of the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is handled by the other variable's expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) as part of the same term, and \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about \\(c\\). But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that for each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we multiply by all terms in \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. That means I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). I notice that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first binomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), while the second binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interfere with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same, but in this case, since the variables are different, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the terms from the second binomial will just contribute a factor that is the sum of all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not exactly correct either. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the product, all terms will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself doesn't exist in the product unless it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in other words, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is... Hmm, I need to find that. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? So, substituting k = 2, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating the binomial coefficient, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times something? Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two parts. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and then we have to consider the entire product. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, I think that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some terms from the second part. But since the second part involves c and 1/c, which are variables different from a and b, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression, and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which doesn't make sense because that would be 6 times \\(2^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. That is, the term where the exponents of c cancel out, so c^0. Let me check that. If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of c to be zero, so 6 - 2m = 0. Solving for m: 6 = 2m => m = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and the second part gives 20c\u2070. So, when multiplied together, we get 6*20 a\u00b2b\u00b2c\u2070, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, then the approach would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the term where the c terms cancel out, giving a constant term. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together: 6*20=120. So, the coefficient is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We seek the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\):\n   \\[\n   m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Hmm, so when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should look at how this term comes about in the product. \n\nWait, but the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), while the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't actually need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is a constant (i.e., a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel out, giving a constant term). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term from the second expansion, you get a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that reasoning. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first expression and the second expression has a constant term, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nIs there any chance I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again. 4 choose 2 is indeed 6 because 4! / (2!2!) = (24)/(2*2) = 6. And 6 choose 3 is 20 because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, that seems correct. \n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can be formed in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second. So, the coefficients do indeed multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

But that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion would contribute differently. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some function of \\(c\\), so perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable as well. Wait, but that's not the case. Let me check the problem again: it says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the expression is a product of two polynomials, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that might not be correct because the problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is another variable. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients would add up. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nLet me check that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so each term in the product would have \\(a^k b^m c^n\\), and we're only interested in the terms where \\(k=2\\) and \\(m=2\\), regardless of \\(n\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^n\\) in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), specifically \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will contribute a coefficient, and since we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to write out the expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. So, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), and \\(b^k = b^2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents. The term from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for each \\(m\\), we have a term with \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, each contributing a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the sum is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a total of 64 terms, each with coefficient 1, so when multiplied by 6, gives 384. Wait, no, that's not quite accurate because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, not necessarily 1. Wait, no, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is expanded using binomial coefficients, so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the sum of all coefficients is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply by 6, you get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this with a specific example. Suppose I take a simpler case where the exponents are lower. For example, suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Indeed, when you multiply out, you get \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, if I take \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is correct because the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient 2. So, this approach seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and check the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum is indeed 64. Therefore, multiplying by 6 gives 384.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the multiplication by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the terms involving \\(c\\), but not the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, actually, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way the product will result in a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.

So, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with powers of \\(c\\). However, since \\(c\\) is a different variable, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that is, the coefficient in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first binomial and a term from the second binomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, that can't be right because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part.

But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the other part, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. That would make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. But wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I'm not sure if it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\) or just the constant term. If it's considering all powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. That doesn't make sense, so I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. But that can't be right because the coefficients are multiplied when you multiply the two expansions. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, but that would give a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. But in reality, each term in the product is a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. However, the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then it's a single number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense for a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must have a typo or is misinterpreted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that \\(c\\) can be any power, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384, but that's only when \\(c = 1\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, not evaluated at \\(c = 1\\). So, perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the sum of all terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Each such term is the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, and this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, I think the problem is either miswritten or I'm misunderstanding it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) is another variable, so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

So, actually, the coefficient is just 6, because when you multiply by the second expression, you're distributing each term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expression. But wait, that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would only appear if the second expression had a constant term, i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the only term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when it's multiplied by the constant term, which is 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, no, that's not right because the second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which, when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of each term is a number.

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so maybe it's just a constant factor when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I might need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second part is raised to the 6th power, and it's a separate variable. So, actually, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate expression, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only present in the first part. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean we're looking for the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the second part is not a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in other words, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), what is the coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify: when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because in the product, each term would have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. Okay, let me work on that. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120, and the variables are \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient will just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe we need to consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because a coefficient should be a constant, not a function of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for each of those would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions with variables. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems unlikely because the answer would then involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't typical for a coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but that isn't specified. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, maybe the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me check that. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, right? Because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression, we also find that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
