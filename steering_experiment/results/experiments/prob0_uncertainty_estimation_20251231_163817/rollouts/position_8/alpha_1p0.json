    "text": " So, maybe I should find the specific term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in k=2, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, you're looking for all terms where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, and you can have any exponent of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms could have different powers of \\(c\\), but if we're only interested in terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then that would be the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might make sense. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me think. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). Maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, I think that's the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, which happens at \\(k=3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem and is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me think. So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}\\) would be \\(a^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, that means the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to see if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you might end up with terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you'll have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some expression involving \\(c\\)], and the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but actually, no. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you have to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second polynomial. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. Because otherwise, if you just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply by the entire second part, you'd have an expression, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". Hmm, maybe it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\) terms. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Let me assume that for a moment. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, I'll compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is given by the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, perhaps I was overcomplicating it by including \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you get terms of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), both positive and negative. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is supposed to be a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which we found to be 20, giving 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, maybe I don't need to expand the second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other terms. But wait, let me make sure. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply out the two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps I need to find the term in the second expansion that's a constant, i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient will be 6 times that constant. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the second part contributing a factor that's being multiplied by the first part? So, actually, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can ignore the terms in the second expansion that have \\(c\\) in them because they would create terms with \\(c\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which we don't want. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term in the product will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by any term from the second part, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, and the exponents add up. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply by any term from the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\) terms, so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have \\(c\\) terms, but the question is just about \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the constant term in the second part. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the product will have terms that are products of an \\(a\\)-\\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\)-\\(1/c\\) term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only when I multiply by the constant term in the second expansion do I get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me check if I made any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6, that's correct. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120.

    "text": " So, in the expansion, the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the constant term? Wait, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only come from the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if the exponents from the second part cancel out. So, the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), I would get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so to get \\(a^2b^2\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I want the exponent to be zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which has coefficient 6) will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives me a constant term with coefficient 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient is indeed 6 * 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me think about it another way. When I expand \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we have \\(4 - k = 2\\) which gives \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the exponent of \\(c\\) in this term is \\(6 - 2m\\), and to have the overall term without \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was realizing that to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I needed the constant term from the second expansion, and then multiplying the coefficients together. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I should find the term where the exponents of a and b are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so yes, that's the term we need. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this \\(6a^2b^2\\) term by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the c terms at all? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, right? So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, then the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, that would mean that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of c would change the term. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of c to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where m=3 is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20, so when I multiply these together, it's 6*20=120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider if there's any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the second part is multiplied by each term in the first expansion, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, I don't think so.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is just a part of the product. So, since the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are in one part of the product and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms are in the other, I think the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems complicated. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms add up if they have the same variables. But in this case, the first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, their exponents don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since they are different variables, the coefficients just get multiplied together. But wait, no, actually, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems more accurate.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, since the two expressions are in different variables, the terms don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficients from the second expression would just be summed up because each term in the second expression is a separate variable. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second expression is in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you expand the entire product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficients of the second part are just numbers, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, you're effectively distributing the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all the terms in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would just be the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables. Wait, that makes more sense. Because the second part is in \\(c\\), it doesn't contribute to the \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients of the terms in the product are the products of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But since the two expressions are in different variables, the terms don't interact in terms of variables. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is multiplied by every term in the second expression, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the first expression's \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me compute that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But let me verify this because I might be making a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by the first expression, so when you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you can treat the second expression as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't seem right because the expansion of the second part has multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with a term that has \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the second expression that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let's compute that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be when \\(c = 1\\), giving 64, and then 6 times 64 is 384. But now, I realize that's incorrect because only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expression, which is 20, and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expression, which is 6, giving 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That makes sense because any other term from the second expression would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expression contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the term \\(1\\) (since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) from the second part, and the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe. Alternatively, since the two parts are multiplied together, and we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents on \\(c\\). But wait, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way for the product to have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\). So, yeah, that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but each of those terms has some power of \\(c\\), so unless the second term is 1, the product won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the term where the second part is 1, which is the \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I want the term where the other variables don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, I guess I need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because then, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times that constant term's coefficient.\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that seems off. Let me check again: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression is the product of two binomial expansions. When I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is the constant term. So, indeed, the coefficient is just 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second expansion could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if there were terms with \\(c\\) that could somehow interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but no, because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are different variables. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), it would give a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, my initial thought was correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check the entire expansion. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When multiplied together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way that can happen is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's exactly what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to check is to compute the entire product and see. But that might be time-consuming, but maybe I can at least compute the specific terms. Let's see, the first expansion's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. The second expansion's constant term is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is it just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the rest is separate? Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms. Wait, so maybe the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is in the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second expression, it would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is a sum, so when you multiply, each term in the second part would add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be, because the second part is a sum, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively distributing. But I think that's not the case because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and the second part is another expansion, so when you multiply, you're just scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expression. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems odd because a coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, the problem statement is a bit unclear, but I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe we're supposed to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable. So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times that expansion. But again, that would mean the coefficient is not just a number but a polynomial. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That seems plausible. Let me try that approach. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Using the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Let me re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because a coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely. I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), that would give me the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: when \\(c = 1\\), \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nWait, alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's correct that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the entire expression being a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misapplying the concept here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought before. So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm overcomplicating, maybe I should just consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, and the rest of the terms are in \\(c\\), so maybe the answer is just 6. But that can't be right because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), then we would need to compute that, but since it's not specified, I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we saw. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a polynomial where each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this polynomial is indeed 64, as calculated earlier. So, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it another way. Suppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, which matches what I thought earlier. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me think. If \\(k\\) is the exponent on \\(b\\), then when \\(k = 2\\), the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient there would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I guess I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is a product, so maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve multiplying by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply out the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the first part, and it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire expansion and see if any terms affect \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients shouldn't be affected by \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6\u00d764=384. \n\nWait, but let me consider another approach. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part, when multiplied, doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but if I think about it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes part of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is indeed \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6\u00d764=384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in these problems, you might have to consider specific terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out or something. But in this case, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then see. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\n\nAs we found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but actually, each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which is the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider specific terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients aren't affected by \\(c\\). So, I think 384 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so I think 384 is the right answer. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables add up to that term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6\u00d764=384. \n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them out, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that term must come from the product where we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion. But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone isn't present in the product unless we multiply it by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) involved.\n\nWait, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense. So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, I need to multiply the coefficients from both parts. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (c^0) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), which is 20a^2b^2. Wait, but I thought I had 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, no, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the coefficient from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the term would be 120a^2b^2c^0, which is just 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is 120. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I should think about how the entire expansion works. So, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), 20, \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the only term that would have just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, that term would be \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 20 multiplied by 6, which is 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, you have to consider all possible combinations, but in this case, since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial contributes a constant term, it's just 6 * 20. So, 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expression as a product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), right? Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which I think refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but it doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that can't be, because in the expansion, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some exponent of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be a different question. Wait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be an infinite sum, but that doesn't make sense because the expression is finite. Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a finite expansion, so when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the product would have specific exponents for \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product only when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). Then, in the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Wait, but that would give a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a series of \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be an infinite series, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is finite.\n\nWait, no, the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a finite expansion. So, the exponents of \\(c\\) go from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would require summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents, which isn't a single coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.

So, that's probably what the problem is asking for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where \\(c\\) is present, but that seems unlikely. No, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) can be any power. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all at their specified exponents. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a single number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and ignoring \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that would be an infinite series, which isn't possible because the second polynomial is finite. Wait, no, the second polynomial is finite, so the exponents of \\(c\\) go from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m\\) is any integer. But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 times 2^6, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. That makes sense because then it's a specific term in the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should specify that \\(c\\) is also squared or something, but I don't know. Given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0 \\Rightarrow m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, maybe I should find the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 each. So, if \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), then to get \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, that would be when k = 2. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the second expansion. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because otherwise, if I multiply by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would change the variables. So, in other words, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 as the constant term. So, when I multiply these two parts, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. So, that should be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Let me double-check that I didn't miss anything. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a constant term 20. So, when I multiply these, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, the whole term we're looking at is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the other variables. Or maybe it's considering the entire expression, but I'm not sure. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. That means I might need to consider how the terms combine when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will multiply each term in the first part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the other variables (c and 1/c) don't affect it because they are different variables. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the other terms. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering all the terms together, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it would just have additional factors of c and 1/c, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would still be 6. Because the coefficient is just the numerical part, and the variables are separate. So, for example, if I have \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), then each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, that coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, but wait, no, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of c, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each c term would just be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving c. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify.\n\nWhen you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first factor, and the second factor is a polynomial in c, each term in the product will be of the form (coefficient from first factor) * (coefficient from second factor) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second factor, because each term in the second factor, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second factor is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because they are different variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, the first part is a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The second part is c + 1/c. So, the product would be (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c). Now, the coefficient of a^2 in the product would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because when you multiply a^2 by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients are 1 and 1, so 1*(1) + 1*(1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of ab would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of b^2 would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of a^2 is 2, which is the coefficient of a^2 in the first polynomial (which is 1) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, yes, that approach works. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is the product of the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 times any term in the second part would contribute to the overall coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, in our problem, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of all coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of a^2b^2 in the entire product is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by substituting c = 1, which gives (1 + 1)^6 = 64, as I thought earlier. So, that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is. Let me try that. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term. The sum of these coefficients is when c = 1, so it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each m, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, we need to sum over all m. So, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific k, then we would have needed to compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\), but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, we sum over all possible m, which gives us 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: maybe I'm overcomplicating it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c, each with their own coefficients. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible c terms is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, to summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n3. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving 64.\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from the first part, and the second part contributes any coefficient, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, each term in the second part will have some coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but then when you sum all those, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider the product as two separate expansions. The first expansion gives terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because for each term in the second expansion, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, but let me check by expanding the second part. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), so the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, since each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interact. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\n3. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that would be the sum over all possible terms in the product where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand this as:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\), right? So, that would mean the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe we can consider that separately. \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and since we're multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) terms, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Or is it more complicated?\n\nWait, no, I think that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But if we're looking for a specific term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2\\), then we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected by the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way it can come from the product is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1 (from the second expression). But wait, the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe we need to find the constant term in that expression, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, we'll still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product. Alternatively, if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me try to expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (the constant term). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the idea is that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. In this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so it's only affected by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, I think that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if the term we were looking for had variables from both expressions, we'd have to consider cross terms, but in this case, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's only influenced by the constant term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, maybe I should find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. Let me see, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a^2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, I think the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, so maybe it's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the expansion would be a product of terms from both expansions. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), so when you multiply by the second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can consider that the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that might not be correct because the entire product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me think. Let me denote the first part as \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times \\text{sum of coefficients in } Q(c)\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(Q(1) = \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the product will have some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part because \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part and any term from the second part is multiplied by it. So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the question is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible terms from the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me think again. Let me try expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) as a coefficient, and they are all multiplied by 6. So, that sum would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m=0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the other variables, meaning that the coefficient would just be 6, because the other terms involve \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and not about the \\(c\\) parts, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), but since \\(m\\) can vary, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. But let me check if there's another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so we're looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, that might be a different approach. Let me see. If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up to zero for \\(c\\). So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is the middle term, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that's different from the 384 I got earlier. So, which one is correct? Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, does it mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\)? If it's regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 384 because every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), and the coefficients add up. But if it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning the coefficient when considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, then it's 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. Wait, no, in reality, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that you're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the sense that \\(c\\) is also involved, then perhaps it's different. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a term in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, but that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. But to make sure, let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But if I look at the product, it's \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). So, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 + 1 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is indeed 1 \u00d7 2, where 2 is the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, applying that logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the second part as well? Wait, but the term I'm interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), just needs to be evaluated as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, is that right? Let me think. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I can treat the second part as a constant multiplier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply, the \\(c\\) terms will combine, and for the product to have \\(c^0\\), the exponents from both parts must cancel out. But wait, actually, in the first part, there are no \\(c\\) terms, so when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will get multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because multiplying by that will give me a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(6! = 720\\), but \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yeah, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me just check if I did everything correctly. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\), right? So, solving for \\(k\\), that would be \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of both parts? Hmm, but the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, when multiplying the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or is it just that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), perhaps the coefficient is simply 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but maybe I'm wrong because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so only the constant term. Wait, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's possible that any power of \\(c\\) is acceptable, as long as the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are 2 each. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should expand both parts separately and then multiply the terms. Let me try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before, which gives terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20c^0, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would be 6 * 1 = 6, for \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) it would be 6 * 6 = 36, and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean adding up all these coefficients. So, 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by this, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 64. So, 6*64=384. Yeah, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"
