    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would happen when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) when \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I also have to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, maybe. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how that term interacts with the second part. But here's the thing: the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms from the first expansion only involve \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the terms from the second expansion only involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, so does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just multiplied by the entire second expansion? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the second expansion isn't a constant. Let me think again. Maybe I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or if it's specifically asking for the term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which makes me think it's considering the entire product, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't just a single number; it would vary depending on the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine in a way that each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in multiple terms of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients from each term in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but that might not be correct either. Let me think carefully. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, as I found earlier. Then, when I multiply this by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will have its own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by each of those coefficients. \n\nWait, but that might not be accurate because the second expansion isn't just a sum of constants; it's a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product isn't just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Instead, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But let me check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in that case, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), I'm confused. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. \n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: when you have two separate products, like \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you multiply them together, each term in the first product is multiplied by each term in the second product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just 6; instead, it's 6 multiplied by each coefficient from the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part being 6, and the second part, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem isn't specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 1. Now, if I were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product, it would be 1 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), so the sum is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, when you expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), you get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). So, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are indeed 2 each, because each is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are coefficients 1 and 1, so sum to 2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial only has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But wait, that's not exactly right because the second polynomial is being multiplied as a whole. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're looking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check by considering the binomial expansions more carefully. \n\nFirst, let's expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nNow, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which is 6a^2b^2) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but the coefficients in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for each \\(m\\), and the sum of these coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion, but since we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the sum of all those products. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly accurate. Because in the product, each term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\), so the coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then it's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, as each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, since each term in the product is of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} c^{m} (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), but we're only interested in the terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) must cancel out, but that's not possible unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion and then multiply it by 6. \n\nWait, that might make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me check that. \n\nIn the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\); it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting interpretations here. Let me try to see which one makes more sense. If I consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) varies. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't a single number because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean the sum over all coefficients in the second expansion multiplied by 6, giving 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. But that seems a bit odd because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is combined with different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think of another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial has terms only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms only in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSince the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nTherefore, after considering all these angles, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of a specific example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 2. The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) in the product would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's expand the product: \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). Expanding this, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2c + 2/c. So, if we consider the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 * 2 = 4. So, that checks out. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but in the specific example, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2, and when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient becomes 2 times each term in the second expansion, but when considering the coefficient of \\(ab\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 2 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2 * 2 = 4. So, that supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nTherefore, I think I've convinced myself that the coefficient is 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) for the exponent of \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so I have two parts multiplied together: one part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the other is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all different, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply these, you get a product where each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. \n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we're looking for all the terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering all terms where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because when you multiply by the second expression, each term will have some power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, and the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that might make sense. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be correct because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a polynomial in the usual sense because it has negative exponents. So, maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\) that isn't 1, which would make it \\(c\\) raised to some exponent, not just a constant. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. That would give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, because the constant term is the only term that doesn't have \\(c\\) raised to any power, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would change the term, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. \n\nOkay, so I think that's the right approach. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. \n\nThe binomial expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need to find the term where this exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nLet me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\) would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on, including \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20 times 6, which is 120, but only if we're considering the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. If we're considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nSo, perhaps I was right the first time. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but only considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. That would make the coefficient 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. That means that in the expanded form of the product, we're looking for all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that's impossible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k\\), it would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by actually expanding the product. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make them \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is not zero. Therefore, the only term in the product that has exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to make sure the constant term is indeed 20. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents are:\n\n- For \\(k=0\\): \\(6 - 0 = 6\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(6 - 2 = 4\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(6 - 4 = 2\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(6 - 6 = 0\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(6 - 8 = -2\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(6 - 10 = -4\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(6 - 12 = -6\\), term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20 when \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) when \\(k = 2\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficients from each part will multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), I just get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what I'm looking for. If I had \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), that would give me terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem again to \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Expanding this, it would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me check that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But we only want the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which is just one term: the \\(c^0\\) term. So, that's why we're looking for the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, and then multiplying by 6. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this term is part of the product with \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion would be of the form (coefficient from first part) \u00d7 (coefficient from second part) \u00d7 \\(a^{k}b^{l}c^{m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can treat the second part as a single value and just multiply it by the coefficient from the first part for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that can't be right either because the second part isn't a single value; it's an expansion. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, and it would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), it's not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is a separate part. But that doesn't make sense because the entire product would have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(terms in }c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product and just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all present in a single term, but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that's a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would occur when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, but that would be 6 \u00d7 (sum from m=0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, as before. So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a single number. Let me check that. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as before. From the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), because to get \\(c^0\\), we need to choose 3 terms of \\(c\\) and 3 terms of \\(1/c\\), so the exponent is \\(3 - 3 = 0\\). \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer would be 120. But the problem didn't specify, so I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same term, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is multiplied in. Wait, no, because the second part is a separate polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient isn't a single number, but a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in this second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\), so \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out what this contributes. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part doesn't matter? Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think. The entire expression is a product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, the second part can contribute any term, but since it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. Actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, the terms combine. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean I need to consider the entire expansion? Wait, but that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part would have some power of \\(c\\), making the combined term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think implies that it's looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, you're adding terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then considering that it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}c^{-(6 - m)}\\) or something? Wait, no, actually, each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, the combined term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and some \\(c\\) exponent. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only present once, multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product of both parts. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed, but the exponents of \\(c\\) vary. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of that term. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Multiplying them gives 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, the entire expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can just find the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a factor that might not affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is multiplied by the first, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expansion.

Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, in other words, in the entire product, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, that doesn't seem right either because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, each would contribute to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients from the second part, but that's not correct because each term in the second part is a separate variable term.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so its expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the a and b coefficients. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied. So, for example, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 (from the first part), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's see: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a (1/c) + b c + b (1/c)\\). So, the term with \\(a\\) is \\(a c\\) and \\(a (1/c)\\), so the coefficient for \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. Wait, but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of c, then it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum, but in reality, the coefficient would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, maybe my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all the c terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c, so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from the first part) times the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach gave me \\(c + 1/c\\), which isn't a constant. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that for each term in the product, if it has \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would include the c terms. But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term from c.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in c, not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's a separate variable. That seems more plausible.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the small example where the coefficient would be multiplied by the second expansion. Hmm. I'm confused now.\n\nWait, let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are powers of c, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various k. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because it's not a constant.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, meaning that it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible c terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in c, which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a constant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when all c terms are combined. But that doesn't make sense either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial in c, which isn't a constant.\n\nWait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's 6, and the c terms are separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the c terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, that approach didn't work because it gave me a non-constant coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the c terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the c terms are separate. But that seems too simple.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the c terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since they are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do get multiplied. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a sum, not a constant. So, in that case, the coefficient is a polynomial in c.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a constant. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient to be a constant, implying that we are to consider the term where the c terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of c is zero. So, in that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of c is zero, and then multiply that by 6.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, that seems plausible. So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of c to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of a, b, and c match.\n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, but that's not a constant. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient when the exponents of c are zero, making the coefficient a constant.\n\nSo, to sum up, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check this again. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). Let me check: \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but wait, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the entire term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the question is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without considering \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, collect all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the second polynomial is being multiplied entirely, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, 6 times 64 is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as distributing the multiplication. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). Each of these is then multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all powers of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but another thought: maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but in reality, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But then, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when they ask for the coefficient of a specific term, they mean the numerical coefficient, assuming all other variables are treated as constants. Wait, but in this case, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that in the entire expansion, all the terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the only way for the coefficient to be a number is if we sum all those contributions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it differently. Let's expand both parts separately and then see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) as I did before gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAs before, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire second expansion becomes 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't set \\(c = 1\\), but instead considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6, giving 384. \n\nSo, after going through this, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, I think so. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I just need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the second part can be anything, but since it's multiplied, I might need to consider the entire expansion of the second part and see if it affects the coefficient. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I only need the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) from the second part, because multiplying by a constant won't affect the variables. So, I need the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about that. The expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the constant term, I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate that. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 times 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only take the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as the entire expression being the product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each expansion for the respective terms. So, yes, that would be 6 times 20, giving 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second part, which is 20, and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, to get the final coefficient of 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nWait, but the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is part of another term. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second expression for the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which would be the constant term, I think. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that.\n\nSo, first, let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, I need to find \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant is 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that would be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for the constant term. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is indeed 20. So, that's correct. And in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's right. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, it's just 6 times the constant term, which is 20, so 6*20=120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and we're looking for the coefficient in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem and is 20.

The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when we multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by 1 (the constant term) in the second expansion.

So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When we multiply the two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1, so it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second part would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) into the term, making it something like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for cross terms, but I think the way I did it is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their coefficients are independent. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is a product of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of a term in the first polynomial and a term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that confirms that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Suppose I expand both expressions and then multiply them, but that would be tedious. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, and the generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is also straightforward. When I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I thought. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the entire product and see. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these two polynomials together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second. But the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial. However, only the constant term in the second polynomial (which is 20) will result in a term that is \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other multiplications would introduce a power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\). So, among these, the only term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is the one with the coefficient 120. All other terms have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they're not \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if there are other ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, could another term from the first polynomial, when multiplied by a term from the second, result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let's see. The first polynomial has terms \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second polynomial has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, 1/c^2, 1/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to multiply a term from the first polynomial that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. If you multiply any other term from the first polynomial by a term from the second, you would get a term that includes \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) along with some power of \\(c\\), which wouldn't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, there's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) except by multiplying the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term by the 20. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in calculating the constant term in the second polynomial. I found that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Then, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That seems correct. So, 20 is correct. And in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which is correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients? But in this case, since the variables are separate, I think the binomial approach is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product and think about how the terms interact, but I think that's more complicated than necessary. My initial approach seems solid.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the second polynomial because it's a separate variable. But no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the presence of the second polynomial affects the overall coefficients. But in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second polynomial as contributing a scalar multiple to the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial that don't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second polynomial only has terms in \\(c\\), the only way to not affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is to multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, that's another way to see that the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that's not relevant here because we're only interested in the constant term, not the sum of all coefficients. So, that approach might not help. Instead, the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the second polynomial when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps I can consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the terms combine. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first polynomial, and the exponents on \\(c\\) are determined by the second. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent on \\(c\\), we would have to sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), but in this case, we're only interested in the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, because otherwise, the term wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) but rather \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nI think I've considered this from multiple angles and each time, I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I feel confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this interacts. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the entire expression, there's another part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts together? Let me think. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think of it as the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all terms in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Or does the second part also affect the coefficients? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is just a scalar multiplied by that term. When I multiply it by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when I multiply, each term will be a separate term with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would just be 6 times the coefficient of each corresponding term in the second expansion. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply by the second expansion, which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, then in the product, this term will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that makes sense. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms like (coefficient from P) * (coefficient from Q) multiplied by the corresponding variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q, because each term in Q is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the entire product being \\(\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} ( \\text{coefficients from P} ) \\times ( \\text{coefficients from Q} ) \\times a^{i}b^{j}c^{k}\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the sum over all k of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in Q). But since in Q, the sum of all coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me compute the second expansion separately. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is when \\(c = 1\\), so 2^6 = 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and any term from the second part will multiply it. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, adding all those up, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients is when all variables are set to 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the second expansion's coefficients. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to:\n\n- For m=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^{6} = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- m=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- m=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- m=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- m=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- m=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- m=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the coefficients are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. Adding them up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. Yes, that checks out. So, the sum is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider another angle. Suppose I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. When I multiply this by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to compute the entire product, I'd have terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, each of those would contribute to terms like 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^6, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2c^4, etc., but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), would be the sum of all these contributions, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly. So, the coefficient should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these gives the final coefficient.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that right? Let me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, if there's no constant term, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second expression. Wait, but if the second expression doesn't have a constant term, then maybe the coefficient is zero? Hmm, let me check that.\n\nWait, actually, no, that's not correct. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where the second expression contributes a 1, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the term that's just 1 in the second expansion is the constant term, and that's what will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient.\n\nSo, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the product of the two expressions is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all possibilities. Is there a chance that other terms from the second expansion could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the first expansion? For example, if there's a term like \\(a^3b\\) in the first expansion multiplied by a term like \\(c^{-1}\\) in the second expansion, would that ever result in \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because the exponents on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are determined solely by the first expansion, and the second expansion only affects the \\(c\\) terms. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents are fixed by the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second expansion only adds terms involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiplying it by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, my initial reasoning seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2.

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in the expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found is just part of the overall expression. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the rest of the expression might not affect this term because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's just a constant factor when considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum, which is not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect it because they don't multiply any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Because otherwise, if \\(c\\) has some exponent, it would be a different term. So, actually, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is the term where \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, so maybe the coefficient is just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by it, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. Let me think. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when I expand the first part, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2\\), and when I expand the second part, I get terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, since each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because if I have, say, \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables, and \\(c\\) is another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion is a separate term. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which are different terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the problem didn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is a separate factor that doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me try to re-express the problem. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would only appear once, multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the only term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a constant. All other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me verify that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Let me just double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. When you multiply these two together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. All other terms in the second expansion would involve powers of \\(c\\), so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product. Therefore, the final answer should be 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part, when expanded, has a constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so that's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two parts together, the coefficients from each part will multiply each other.

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, it needs to be multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c^k\\), that would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. \n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term in the second part is 20.

So, perhaps it's just the coefficient in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, how would that work? Because when you multiply by the second part, you'd have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me assume that's the case.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), I need to consider both parts. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. I think I confused myself at first, but I think this approach is correct. The key is that since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the coefficient would actually be a term that includes all possible combinations from the second expansion. But if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression, but only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the steps. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any conditions on \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider expanding the entire expression. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it would give terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be the sum of all those terms, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think I can confidently say the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, we also need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, that term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient I found, 6, is part of the expansion of the first part, but I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait a minute, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider the term in the first expansion that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, because the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, but here we have an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the variables are separate. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all terms. But that would require multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion and then collecting the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would just be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that's not a single number. I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-express the problem: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6 \\(a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{some expansion}\\), then when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{each term in the second expansion}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer should be 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but if we're just considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and identifying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Since the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " That means I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. So, in terms of exponents, that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me see, in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I need the term where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) implies that the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, maybe I don't need to consider the entire expansion of the second part, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just 1 when considering the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the second expression only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first expression involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the variables are different. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\)), it's like 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second factor only has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're adding terms that have different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variable part, we need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the entire second factor, because when you multiply, each term in the first factor is multiplied by each term in the second factor. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in the second factor, because each term in the second factor will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), etc. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we're treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and we're looking for all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 for \\(c\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is correct. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is indeed 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe by considering that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, the coefficient remains 6, but that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied by each term. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables together. So, that would mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific coefficient from the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Let me check with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two separate expansions. So, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those products. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems consistent. Alternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that wouldn't make sense because the expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem probably expects a numerical coefficient. Maybe the question is only considering the coefficients in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But then, the coefficient would include terms involving \\(c\\), which isn't typical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the term in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient in terms of \\(c\\), but the way it's phrased, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", suggests that maybe it's just 6, but that can't be because the entire expression is multiplied by another term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the coefficient is a constant, not involving \\(c\\). That might make sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That would give me the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) = 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are usually constants. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nLet me double-check my steps. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product expression. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, and not a polynomial, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\)) occurs when \\(k = 3\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients found:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is going to be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is a separate expansion, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because when you multiply by the second expression, it doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, the coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider that each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will just add another term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider that each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables, we need to sum over all possible contributions. Wait, no, that might not be right either. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. In this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms in the second polynomial don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by its own coefficient. So, if the second polynomial has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., each term's coefficient will be multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial, and then all those will add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but the terms are multiplied. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial has multiple terms, each term in the second polynomial will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term in second polynomial)}\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nWait, but actually, that's not accurate. Because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, each of these terms has a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients of each of these terms, because each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in the first polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are different, so the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because the second polynomial is not being summed; it's being multiplied. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial has multiple terms. I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products of terms from the first polynomial and terms from the second polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables are separate. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each term in the second polynomial has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, you can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so when you multiply them, you get 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nYes, that seems to make sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
