    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect it. But wait, let me think again. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the entire term. So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms because the \\(c\\) part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Let me check that. If I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), when expanded, each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) is multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm being asked about the coefficient in the entire product, but only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that might not make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) term. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating all variables together, so it's possible that when you multiply, the \\(c\\) terms could influence the coefficient, but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would just be 6. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the way to interpret this is that the entire expression is a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Now, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because it's multiplied by another expression. But that doesn't seem right because the problem includes the entire product. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me try to write out the product: \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion would have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\) in steps of 2. Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, but in the product, it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times each of those coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I think that's not the case because the problem includes the entire product. So, I think the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be 6 \u00d7 \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by 6. That is, 6 \u00d7 (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that's the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just extra. But the problem says \"in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\", so I think it's considering the entire product, and thus the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when you expand this, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 \u00d7 the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have products like this, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as in the first part, which is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But I think that's not the case because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes all variables. So, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, giving 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of it another way. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) remains the same when multiplied by Q(c), because Q(c) doesn't involve a or b. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) is 6, and when you multiply by Q(c), it's 6 \u00d7 Q(c). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 \u00d7 Q(c), but since Q(c) is a polynomial in c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of Q(c), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve a or b. But that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Therefore, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in c. But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the entire expression, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which has coefficients 1 and 1 for \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), respectively. But if I'm just looking for the numerical coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of c, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is itself a function of c. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is multiplied by c terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, so maybe it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my simple example, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which is two terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is not just a single number but a polynomial in c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a numerical value. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), ignoring \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the entire expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, another way to look at it: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me check this with another approach. Let me compute the product:\n\n\\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\n\\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 2^6 = 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nWhen multiplying \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Or do I? Hmm, wait, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will just contribute a factor that is multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, the second part can be considered as a constant multiplier. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = \\text{something}\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\text{something else}\\), when I multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product would just be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too big because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're just looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? Or are we supposed to consider the entire term, including \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually means the coefficient when all other variables are treated as constants. So, in this case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe we need to consider the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by every term from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I thought before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire expression. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant multiplier, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is not a constant. Wait, perhaps the problem is a product of two separate expansions, and we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the second part, but that would result in a polynomial, not a single number. I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, I would have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m / c^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are such that \\(m - n = 6\\) or something? Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part (6) by the entire expansion of the second part, resulting in a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by whatever the second part contributes. But since the second part is a separate expansion, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to write it out more formally. Let me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying the second sum, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which corresponds to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for each \\(m\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that seems to suggest that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems plausible. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by another variable. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6. But I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only asked for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression also includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we consider the sum of coefficients in the second part by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Wait, so the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think I just need the coefficient from the first part because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), right? Let me see: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would expand to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the first part is only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the product would have terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient from the second expansion would be 1 for the constant term? Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part contributes a factor that is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, any term in the second expansion that's a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only term in the second expansion that will contribute is the constant term, which is the term where \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from the other expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Then, for the second part, I needed the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That happens when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does the entire expression multiply together, and maybe I have to consider all possible terms? Hmm, maybe I should think of the entire expansion as the product of two expansions: one for \\((a + b)^4\\) and another for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would involve taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then adding all those products together. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the other expansion does involve \\(c\\), when we multiply, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient in the entire product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I expand the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the product. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, which gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found earlier. Now, when we multiply this by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m} = c^{2m - 6}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^{2m - 6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which is a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But wait, that's not correct because the second part isn't a constant; it's an expression with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, because each term in the second expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because if you substitute \\(c = 1\\), then each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the sum would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be combined with every possible term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{m}(1/c)^{6 - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, it's as if you're scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me check this again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me think differently. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(c^{2m - 6}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Since \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should expand both parts and see. Let me try that. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{2m - 6}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) of \\(2m - 6\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) because they are separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to the overall coefficient. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant here because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by 1, because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, would have a term where \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so that term's coefficient would be the middle term of the expansion.

But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\text{(term from first expansion)} \\times \\text{(term from second expansion)}\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be the term where the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and exponent of \\(b\\) is 2, multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, let's calculate that. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Let me verify. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\text{sum of terms}\\), each with their own coefficients. When I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of coefficients is 64. Let me think again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that part is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each of those terms has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) because that's the middle term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The term where the exponent is 0 is when the number of \\(c\\) terms equals the number of \\(1/c\\) terms, which is when we choose 3 \\(c\\)s and 3 \\(1/c\\)s. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. Now I'm confused. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then I need to consider all possible terms in the second expansion. But if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, it should be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing their own coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part, so it's probably expecting me to consider the entire product. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part, giving 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but now I'm thinking that maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, it should be 384.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting answers depending on how I interpret the problem. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, every term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. In this case, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1. The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Now, if I expand the product, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The \\(a^2\\) term would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\), so the coefficients are 1 and 1, summing to 2, which matches. Similarly, the \\(ab\\) term would be \\(2ab c + 2ab /c\\), coefficients 2 and 2, summing to 4. And the \\(b^2\\) term would be \\(b^2c + b^2/c\\), coefficients 1 and 1, summing to 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (from first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients from second part). Therefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients from second part) = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or do I? Let me think. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me see. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly correct because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe they're treating \\(c\\) as a variable that's separate, and so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I think about it, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression in \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we just need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not a single coefficient; that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that seems unlikely because \\(c\\) is separate. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that's not a single coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and we're to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's assuming that the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied, but we're only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. So, is the coefficient 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when multiplying the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense because then we're looking for a specific term. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is just part of the overall expression. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. Hmm, maybe I should look at the problem differently. Let me consider that the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because then we're looking for a specific term in the entire expansion. So, let's assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, what is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? To find that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let's let \\(d = c\\), so \\(\\left(d + \\dfrac{1}{d}\\right)^6\\). The general term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} d^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{d}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} d^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(d\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression, assuming we're considering \\(c^0\\), is 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and not the \\(c\\) parts, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the other part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me consider that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384 times \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and not considering the \\(c\\) terms at all. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression includes the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion, but that's not a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. So, maybe the second part doesn't affect this term? Let me think. Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply them, you get terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means that in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) would be the constant term, because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, the \\(c\\) terms would come from the second part. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is being considered, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 as the constant term, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20, which is indeed 120. Hmm, but wait a second, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to consider the entire product. Let me think again. The original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the second part, I might think it's just 6, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, I need to include the effect of the second expansion. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\nStep 1: Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.

    "text": " Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), right? So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be whatever it is multiplied by the rest, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient? Wait, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them out, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the two parts separately and just multiply the coefficients? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so any term in the second expansion would just be a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), but wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand that, the terms would be of the form \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 6 down to -6, in steps of 2, maybe? Wait, no, because each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents on \\(c\\) would be even numbers from 6 down to -6, I think. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), we need the term where the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the second expansion, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, let's set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since the two are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems right. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two separate expansions, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part, and multiplying their coefficients together. So, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I might not need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they would multiply other terms, not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify: The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's being multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that must mean that we need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms affect this. Wait, no, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by the second expansion, it would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions with variables. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expansion and looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is an expression, not a number. That seems unlikely. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. That makes more sense. So, let me proceed under that assumption. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's work on the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients from each polynomial for the respective terms. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, is that accurate? Let me think again. Let me denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, \\(P \\times Q = \\sum_{i} p_i \\times \\sum_{j} q_j = \\sum_{i,j} p_i q_j\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(p_2 = 6\\), then in the product, it's \\(p_2 \\times \\sum q_j\\), because every \\(q_j\\) is multiplied by \\(p_2\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Because when you set \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient, so the sum is \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check again because I might be making a mistake here. Let me think: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply by \\(Q\\), which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\), which is 64. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to just take the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). Let me think differently. Alternatively, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, the second part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is raised to the 6th power, so it's contributing a factor. Wait, but no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times whatever the coefficient is from the second part when considering terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each coefficient in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, as I thought before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", they might just be referring to the coefficient in the first part, not considering the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, actually, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, but in this case, the first part has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has various terms, but none of them affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each term in the second part is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), so the entire product would have terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient from second part)} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the final answer should be 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is the product. So, I think 384 is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I'm misapplying the concept here. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I thought before. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because for each \\(m\\), we have a term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Since \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, yes, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expressions. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), contributes \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first polynomial, and \\(c\\) is only in the second, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as we calculated by substituting \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms each of which is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6.

    "text": " Wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other terms, they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, it will create a new term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any other term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by other terms, the resulting terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), so unless there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), those terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, so maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, it will just scale \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant, contributing to its coefficient. But if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term, like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), that would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term and doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this constant term, the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as two separate expansions and then look for the coefficient. Let me try that approach to confirm. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, only the terms in the second expansion that are constants (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making the resulting term different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). As calculated earlier, that constant term is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients. Since the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Which is exactly what I did. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. I think that's the correct answer. Let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is also correct. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is indeed 120. So, yeah, the coefficient should be 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like you're scaling it by each term in the second polynomial, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the second part can be treated as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient in the entire product, which would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible terms from both expansions. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would multiply the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be correct. Let me think: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other part. So, for example, if you have \\((x + y)(z + w)\\), the coefficient of \\(x\\) would be 1 times (z + w), and the coefficient of \\(y\\) would be 1 times (z + w). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the term that is \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) involved. So, perhaps I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes more sense because then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find this, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the exponent to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying this by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, I get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be incorrect because we need the specific term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero. So, I think the correct approach is the second one, where I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I think my initial confusion was about whether to consider the entire sum of coefficients or just the specific term that would result in a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The correct approach is the latter because we want the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But I'm not sure. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are separate, so the variables are different.

Because when you multiply each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. As I calculated before, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me check that again. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively taking each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think that term would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider that it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but I don't think that's the case because the other part is in terms of \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by that term, but that doesn't make sense either. Wait, no, the entire expression is a product, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, each of which is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. But wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply by each term, each term has its own coefficient, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but that would mean the coefficient is actually the sum of 6 times each coefficient, which would be 6 times the sum of coefficients, which is 6*64=384. So, maybe that's the answer. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but I don't think that's right because the problem includes the entire product. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but since the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify, so I think it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. But wait, let me check this again. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be (a + b)(c + 1/c). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be (c + 1/c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's (c + 1/c). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem, it would be 6*(c + 1/c)^6. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term is a product. Wait, no, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient would be 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think the answer is 384. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k=2. So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). Now, for the second part, we can have any m from 0 to 6, so the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and since we're multiplying by 6, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6*\\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all m of 6*\\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is 6*64=384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in this expansion contributes to the coefficient, resulting in 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is in the second part for the term where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) combine to give a constant term? Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all, because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that any term from the second expression that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms would just multiply the coefficient by 1. Wait, no, that's not right. Because actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a separate variable. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only concerned with the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride, so to speak. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which would include the coefficients from both parts. Wait, no, because the variables are separate. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to consider all the terms in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term from the second expression. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expression has its own coefficient, and when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those, the coefficients add up. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me verify this approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, perhaps it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that \\(c\\) terms can affect the exponent of \\(a^2b^2\\), but that doesn't seem right because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm correct that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are just there as part of the expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) would be the term that doesn't change the exponent of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve finding the constant term in the second part and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. That makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as before. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense. So, probably the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second part and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the answer would be 120. Let me confirm that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. So, that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me think again. If the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\", then it's a bit ambiguous whether it's considering \\(c\\) terms or not. But in most cases, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term involving specific variables, it's implying that the other variables should have exponents that don't affect the term, i.e., zero. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. But I think the more reasonable interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables, so each term in the product will be a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) term. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6, because each \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the 6 is the coefficient, and the rest is part of the other terms. Wait, but actually, no, that's not quite right. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when you expand them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get 6\\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term will be a combination of an \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part is just a separate expression, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is just additional terms, so the answer is 6. But that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.

Let me think. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms in the product where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) parts. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would get multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expression. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would give \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two independent binomials, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which when considering the product, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the second expression becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) part can be anything. But that doesn't seem right because the product would have terms involving \\(c\\) as well. Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which in the entire product would include all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes to a different power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all those terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, if the second part's sum of coefficients is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. Wait, but let me check this another way. Let me think about how the product works. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts separately and then multiply, the coefficients would multiply accordingly. So, yes, I think 384 is the right answer. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

Hmm, perhaps I do, because the entire expression is the product of both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that term is independent of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the entire expression will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to consider the constant term in the second expansion, that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that won't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient we found earlier, which was 6. So, let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, the constant term is 20, so when you multiply the two, you get 6*20=120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is the product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I expand the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only interested in the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems correct, but I'm a bit unsure because the problem seems to be more complicated than that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Now, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we're considering all possible products where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, each such product would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, in effect, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But wait, that's not correct because the second expansion is a sum, so when you multiply, you're distributing each term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply by the second expression, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficients would add up. So, for example, if the second expression had a term with coefficient 1, then \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 * 1, but if the second expression has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, then the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is indeed 64, as we found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Here, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a numerical coefficient but an expression. So, in that case, the coefficient isn't a number but another expression. But in our original problem, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by the second expression, it would become \\(a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), but that's not a numerical coefficient. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied, so it should contribute to the coefficient. Wait, but in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second part is a separate expansion, so when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would have terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we can use the binomial theorem again. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so it might be considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, which would indeed be 384. But I'm a bit confused because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\), you might be considering the term as part of a polynomial, but here, the entire expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well. So, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is just 6, but that seems incorrect because the second part is being multiplied, so it should contribute to the coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me check that again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 * 64 = 384. I think I need to clarify the problem. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. I'm a bit unsure, but given that the problem is written as is, I think it's more likely that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. No, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), its coefficient in the product would be the product of its coefficient in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me test this with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so \\(a\\) would have coefficient 2. But actually, in the product, the term \\(a\\) would be multiplied by both \\(c\\) and 1, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, which is correct. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting 1 into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. Let me compute that: \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me confirm this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the expansion of both parts and see if they interact in a way that affects the coefficient. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, it would create a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion doesn't have a constant term because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Wait, actually, when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which was 64, but actually, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both parts and see. Let's see: The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but the only term without \\(c\\) is the middle term when the exponent is 3, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{3} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = 20 \\times c^{0} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term in the second expansion. Wait, but no, actually, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that only the constant term contributes because otherwise, the \\(c\\) terms would affect the coefficient. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\(a c + a + b c + b\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But wait, earlier I thought it was 120 because I considered only the constant term. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, it would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. But I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes problems like this might be looking for a specific term, but since it's not specified, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with their own coefficients. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's only considering the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is 120. Wait, that makes more sense because if you don't specify the power of \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expansion of both parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in even steps. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(k = 0\\), because otherwise, it would have a \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more accurate. Because if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^2\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), giving 90. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm convinced it's 120. Let me double-check the second expansion. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the exponents of \\(c\\) are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term with coefficient 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
